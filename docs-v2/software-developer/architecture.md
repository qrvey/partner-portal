This article discusses the architecture of the Qrvey platform and how all of our components work together to deliver on the promise of a unified, all-in-one data solution. If you are new to Qrvey, first see [Introduction to the Qrvey Platform](../getting-started/intro-to-qrvey.md).


## Working with the Qrvey platform 

There are three main ways to interact with the Qrvey platform. First, we offer a robust API that allows for direct interaction with all of Qrvey's functions for data collection, analytics, automation, and information distribution. Second, we offer a suite of pre-built widgets to simplify the process of embedding Qrvey into existing web pages and applications. Every part of the Qrvey platform can easily be embedded. Finally, there is Qrvey Composer, a web-based application used by Data Analysts to create and manage datasets, visualizations, and dashboards to share with external users.

## Qrvey Architecture 

Qrvey is built on a fully scalable cloud architecture utilizing a variety of AWS services to deliver maximum performance for all of your data and application requirements.   

On the backend, we leverage Elasticsearch and DynamoDB to support both massive scale and unstructured to semi-structured data.

For developers, we provide a comprehensive set of APIs and widgets to integrate with your existing applications, data and services.

Out of the box, we also provide a number of supporting services to provide advanced analytics, messaging, and additional customizations.
