Everything that is created in Qrvey Composer is ultimately for the benefit of an “End User”. In some cases, the Data Analyst persona may be the same as the End User, and in other cases they may be different people. However, in all cases, the permissions and interactions with the content are different between the two personas: **Data Analysts create content that End Users interact with**.

At the same time, different users may have different needs: Some prefer one chart over another. Some may like their dashboards to be filtered a certain way. Still, others may like their panels to be a different size or charts use different colors for added clarity.

All of this, and more, is possible through the **End User Personalization** feature. If enabled and properly configured, end users will have control over the content that is shared with them. This includes changing the layout of the page, swapping in or out charts that they want to see on their dashboards, as well as changing the chart types and filters. They can also revert to the original content if they wish to do so.

Personalization does not affect the original content that might be shared among a larger group of users. As a result, the same dashboard that can be accessed by different users may look very different for each of them and have little resemblance to the original. 

End Users have to be authenticated in order for the personalization feature to work. This ensures that their settings are stored and can be accessed across different devices.

Through the User Management feature in Qrvey Composer, Data Analysts can decide which pieces of content to show or hide to which group of users. If you embed the Dashboard View widget in your product, Software Developers can enable or disable the options that are available in the widget for the authenticated end users to enjoy. All available options and personalization features inside the Dashboard View and the Dashboard Builder widget can be turned on or off in any combination desired.

If you're a Software Developer, see [Dashboard View Widget](../embedding-widgets/widgets/dashboard-view.md) for information on enabling individual personalization features.  

If you're a Data Analyst:
* See [User Management](../../composer/dashboards/user-management/overview-of-user-management.md) to learn how to create end users.
* See [Personalizing Your Dashboards](../end-user-personalization/personalizing-dashboards.md) to learn about personalization features that are available to end users.
