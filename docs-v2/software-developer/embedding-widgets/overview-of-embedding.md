Developers can seamlessly embed the Qrvey platform’s self-service data collection, automation, and analytics functionalities into their web applications. The Qrvey platform provides a comprehensive suite of “widgets” that are directly embedded into applications using simple Javascript and custom HTML tags. These widgets provide various front-end application features, including web form builders, data visualizations, and more.

Many of the widgets are actually part of Qrvey Composer and perform the same function. In order to provide the best experience for your end users, you should be familiar with how these features work in Qrvey Composer.

For information on the structure of a widget, see [Widgets Quick Start Guide](../embedding-widgets/widget-quick-start-guide.md).
