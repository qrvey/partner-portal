Qrvey makes it easy to publish your web forms just about anywhere. This article discusses different ways you can use your forms, surveys, and quizzes. For information on embedding web forms, see [Embedding Web Forms](../publishing/embedding-web-forms.md).

> **Note:** Before you can use or share any web forms, you must first activate the web form by clicking the **Activate** button at the top of the Publish page. To pause and make changes to your web form, you will need to click the **Pause** button.


## Publishing Within Qrvey Applications

The most common place you’ll find Qrvey web forms is inside Qrvey Composer.  Web forms play a crucial part of apps you build with Qrvey Composer, as they are the primary way for users to enter information.  Web Forms can be used as components in **Dashboard Builder**, as well as in **Workflows** to become a powerful part of your automation.

### Workflows
You can send a web form to a user by choosing **Send Web Form** from the action dropdown list. Web forms can automatically be sent via email or SMS text message; you can even automatically follow-up with people who have not responded.

### Dashboard Builder
You can drag and drop any active web form onto a dashboard or a report. To do this, select the web form from the tool palette and position it on the page or report.

## Shareable URL
If you’d like to share your web form outside of an app you are building in Qrvey Composer, the shareable URL is the easiest way to do so. First, navigate to the **Publish** tab of your web form.

Next, scroll down to locate the web form’s URL. Copy and paste the link where desired.

## Embedding Option
Qrvey Composer has an embedding option available if you’d like to display your web form inside an external application, such as a website, blog, web or mobile app. The first and simplest method is to use an **iFrame**, which essentially just creates a small window in a web page that points directly to your Qrvey web form. Just click on **iFrame** and then copy and paste the code provided into your external application.
