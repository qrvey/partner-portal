You can package up your entire application, including any data you’ve added or collected, and send it to another Qrvey user so that they can either use the app themselves or build upon it. 

In this article, we’ll review the steps needed for both sending, and receiving, an application. 

## Sending an Application
To send an app to another user, start by navigating to the application dashboard and select **Send** from the drop-down menu in the lower-right corner.

Next, select the email address of the Qrvey user you'd like to send your application to.

Note, that your recipient(s) must have an active account with the same Qrvey instance in order to receive your application.  If your recipients do not have a Qrvey account, they must sign up before attempting to send them an application.

You can modify the application's name and description if you'd like, or just use the app's existing information.

After clicking **Send**, you will be taken back to the application dashboard and you will see the green confirmation message shown below.

>Please note that it may take up to several minutes for your application to be packaged and sent to your recipient - depending on the amount of components and data your application has.

## Receiving an Application
If someone has sent you an application, you’ll see a notification number appear in the application dashboard alongside the **Received** tab. Click the received tab to view your incoming apps.

Click on the application name to see more details, including who sent you the application and when. Click **Install** to add the application to your account.

Depending on the size of the application, it may take a few minutes for the application to finish installing it. Once it’s complete, the green notification below will be displayed to let you know that the application is ready to begin being used. Once installed, the application will look and behave just like your other applications.

Received applications may be installed as many times as you’d like. If you won’t be needing a received application, you can delete it by selecting **Delete** in the drop-down menu in the lower-right corner of the app.
