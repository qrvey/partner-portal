The *Activity Log* records all major activity in your user account across all of your applications. It logs events in an application, such as creation, deletion, and major changes, as well as sending or receiving applications. Click on the **Activity Log** tab in the top toolbar to access this feature.

Click the **Details** link next to an event to see additional details about it, like for example who started the process, how many records it contains, how many records were read successfully and how many had failed, and how much time it took to read individual records as well as the total run time.
