# Intro to Qrvey Composer

Qrvey Composer is a web-based platform that enables data analysts to import and manage datasets from many sources, design data visualizations within drag-n-drop dashboards, build web forms, setup automated workflows, and generate pixel perfect reports.
The platform is tailored for the specific needs of SaaS companies, enabling them to share, distribute, or [embed features of Qrvey](../software-developer/04-Embedding Qrvey Widgets/widget-quick-start-guide.md) within their own software for customized data experiences.

2. **[Dashboards](../composer/06-Building%20Dashboards/overview-of-dashboards.md)** — Allow analysts to create, browse, configure, and deploy interactive data visualization dashboards.
3. **[Automation](../composer/09-Automation/overview-of-automation.md)** — Set triggers, then define conditions and actions to automate tasks within an application.
4. **[Pixel-Perfect Reports](../composer/10-Pixel-perfect%20Reports/overview-of-pixel-perfect-reports.md)** — Build highly customizable and detailed reports out of your data and data visualizations.
5. **[Settings](../composer/11-Configuring%20Settings/overview-of-settings.md)** — Configure the global settings for an application.
