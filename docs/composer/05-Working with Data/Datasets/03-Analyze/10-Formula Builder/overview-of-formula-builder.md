Formula Builder is an interactive user interface that enables you to quickly create, test, and save formulas. Formulas enable you to create new columns of data that do not already exist in the dataset. For example, you can create a formula to segment data, aggregate data, calculate ratios, and much more. Once a formula is created and saved, it is available in Chart Builder, Pixel-perfect Reports, and the Analyze widget as a new column that can be added to a chart or visualization. The Qrvey platform computes the values of that column in real time, when the end user displays the chart or visualization. 

For a video tutorial on using Formula Builder, see the video [Formulas and Buckets](../../../../../video-training/legacy/formulas-buckets.md). 

Formula Builder is opened from within Chart Builder, Pixel-perfect Reports, or the Analyze widget. Click the sigma icon on the toolbar:

The Formulas dialog displays with a list of existing formulas.

To create a new formula, click **Create Formula**. The Create Formula dialog displays. 

Formula Builder provides the following two modes for creating formulas:
* **Data Engine Syntax (legacy)**. Create formulas using a database-specific syntax. For more information, see [Using Data Engine Syntax Mode](./using-data-engine-syntax.md). 
* **Standardized Syntax (new)**. Create formulas using a standardized syntax that is compatible with any database connected to the Qrvey platform. Introduced in Version 8.2. For more information, see [Using Standardized Syntax Mode](./using-standardized-syntax.md).
