Standardized Syntax Mode enables you to create formulas using a standardized language rather than a specific syntax for a specific database engine. Formulas created in Standardize Syntax Mode work with any database engine supported by the Managed Connect and Live Connect features.

For general information on using the Formula Builder interface, see [Overview of Formula Builder](./overview-of-formula-builder.md).
