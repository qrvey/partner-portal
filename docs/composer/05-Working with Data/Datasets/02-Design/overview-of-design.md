The Design tab of the Data feature enables you to design your dataset. The following diagram provides an overview of its features.

1. **Name and dataset status** - Here you can change the name of the dataset by clicking on it and typing in a new one. You can also favorite the dataset by clicking on the star next to its name, and get information on the last time the dataset was loaded, how many columns and records it has.
2. **Load Dataset button** - Before a dataset can be used after being created or modified, it must be loaded. 
    When modifying a dataset that has already been loaded, instead of the Load Dataset button, you will see **Discard Changes**, **Apply Changes**, and **Reload Dataset**.

3. The three dot menu where you can share data with everyone (after it has been loaded), mark the dataset as favorite, enable or disable label internalization, and unshare the dataset if it had been shared beforehand.

4. The Data source column pill and the three-dot menu where you can edit connection settings, edit data source query, join to another data source, select a different data source, or rename the current data source.
