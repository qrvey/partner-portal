If your data contains address information that you wish to display on any type of map chart, you need to create a Geolocation Group out of your desired address fields.

To create a Geolocation Group you have to map your address data column or columns to the address type fields in the dialog. For example you may map the data column zip  to the Postal/Zip Code field. While any portion of address is enough to create a Geolocation Group, mapping more columns, especially unique columns such as the country, help create more accurate points on your map charts.  
You can give your geolocation group a name to identify it with.  

Defining, or changing Geolocation Groups will ***not*** require a data reload.
