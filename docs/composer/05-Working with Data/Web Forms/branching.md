Branching is a powerful feature that allows you to ask follow-up questions based on the respondent's answer to the previous question.

For example, if you ask “How are you feeling today?” with the choices for “Good” and “Bad”, you may want to continue by asking different questions based on the respondent’s mood. 

**Note**: Branching is currently available for most survey and form question types, excluding password, digital signature, image, and file upload. 

# Adding Branches
To create a branch, add your questions and answer choices, then check the **+Add Branch** link in the lower right-hand corner.

In the next section, you will give your branch a name, choose the answers to which it should apply, and then choose what you would like to happen next.  In the example below, we’ve named our branch the “Great” branch and will assign it to the answer “Great” from the question above.

From the dropdown menu, we can now choose whether respondents should move onto the next question (**Follow branch**), end the survey (**End now**) or jump to some other point of the survey (**Jump to**).

## Nested Branching
Qrvey currently allows up to five levels of branching for more complicated question structures.

## Jump Logic
Within any of your branches, you can add jump logic to move a respondent to a different question in your survey or form. Go to the dropdown menu and just look for the question you’d like respondents to jump to. 

You also have the option to end the survey or form immediately by selecting **End**, or wait until all of the questions in the current branch have been answered, as shown below.

## Deleting Branches
To delete a branch, look for the three-dot icon in the lower right-hand corner of the branch you’d like to delete and choose **Delete**. 

**Note:** Deleting a branch will delete all of the questions and logic within that branch.
