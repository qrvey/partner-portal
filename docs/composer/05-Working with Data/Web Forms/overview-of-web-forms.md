Web Forms are the mechanism with which Qrvey application collect new information from humans. They're also the primary way people update existing data within Qrvey apps. 

## Types of Web Forms
The Qrvey platform currently has three different types of web forms: forms, surveys, and quizzes. Each of these form types is similar but has slightly different features, depending on your data collection use case.  Web form types are discussed in the next section. 

## Use Cases
Web Forms can be used in a variety of ways:  they can be a vital part of your Qrvey applications, residing inside the dashboards and reports you create with the Qrvey platform; they can also be embedded into other websites or applications; and they can be shared in a variety of ways, including via social media or email. 

## What Makes Up a Web Form
Web Forms primarily include data fields, which are called questions if you’re creating a survey. Surveys may also include branching, which allows you to ask different questions based on the answers to the previous question.  Quizzes include a scoring feature that enables you to rank the results in the order they’re received. 

Every time a user completes a web form, the data is saved in the Qrvey platform either as a new or existing record for analysis. The results of this analysis can then be included in workflows, dashboards, and reports throughout the rest of your application.
