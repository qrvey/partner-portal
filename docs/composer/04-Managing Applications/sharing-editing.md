## Sharing & Editing
Users working with Qrvey composer can now share applications with other users to collaborate on content and asset creation.

The sharing option can be found on the Home Page, in the menu found in each application card.

Creators can decide to make applications public, meaning that all creator users will see the application and will be able to work with it in the same way that the owner of the application can. They will be able to create new content, edit, and delete existing assets.

Applications can also be shared only with specific people by adding the email of the person.
