When you create an application in Qrvey Composer, it is (by default) private to your user account. If you need to collaborate with others on the application, use the Sharing feature to enable other users in Qrvey Composer to view and edit the application. This feature enables you to share an application with up to 50 user accounts. You can share an application with more than 50 accounts by selecting Roles instead of individual accounts, or by sharing the application with the entire organization. 

To share an application:
1. Open the Applications page to display the list of applications available to your user account. 
2. Locate the application that you want to share, click its three-dot menu, and click **Share**. The Share Application dialog displays.

3. To share the application with all Qrvey Composer users in your organization, select **Share with my organization**. 
4. To share the application with specific users, under **Share with specific people**, select the desired user accounts and/or roles. Note that you may have to clear the **Share with my organization** check box to activate these fields. 
5. Click **Done**.
