A Qrvey application is a self-contained analytics project that can be used directly, shared, distributed, or embedded into other software applications. Qrvey applications connect to one or more datasets, and they typically include any number of analytics components, such as charts, reports, dashboards, and automated workflows. Qrvey applications can be created in Qrvey Composer or programmatically via API.  

The Qrvey platform offers a wide range of features that can be used in a Qrvey application, including:
* **Web Forms**. Collect data from external users by creating web forms, surveys, and quizzes.
* **Data Connections**. Create a connection to a wide range of cloud-based and on-premise data stores, document databases, columnar databases, REST APIs, JSON and CSV data files, and more. 
* **Analytics**. Analyze data using pre-built visualizations or create custom charts and metrics.
* **Dashboard Builder**. Create highly interactive dashboards and mashups of visualizations across multiple datasets. A dashboard can include any combination of forms, charts, metrics, and analytics, as well as standard web components like text, images, headers and footers. Additional features include navigation and user authentication.
* **Automation**. Create automated workflows to perform virtually any task supported in the Qrvey platform. 

The Applications page of Qrvey Composer displays all the Qrvey applications available to the current user of Qrvey Composer. The Applications page displays when you initially log in to Qrvey Composer. You can also click the home icon at the top left corner of the Qrvey Composer user interface.
