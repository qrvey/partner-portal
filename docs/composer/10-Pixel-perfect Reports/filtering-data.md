> Pixel-perfect Reports is a new feature currently in *beta* introduced with version 8.1 of the Qrvey platform. Your feedback and ideas are greatly appreciated, as they can help us improve this feature in future releases.

## Filtering Data
Filters enable you to refine the data that is displayed in the reports. Filters in Pixel-perfect Reports are configured similar to Filters in Qrvey Composer. The only difference is that filters in Pixel-perfect Reports are not applied while the canvas is in Edit mode. The filters are applied when you preview a report. 

To create a filter, display the Filters panel and click **Add Filter**.

For more information on configuring filters, see [Introduction to Filters](../08-Filtering%20Data/overview-of-filters.md). 


## Bucketing Data
Pixel-perfect Reports enables you to create buckets in your reports and add them to your reportâ€™s dataset. Buckets can improve the ability to analyze data by grouping multiple data points into a single item. The report must have an associated dataset in order to create a bucket. Once created, buckets are linked to the dataset in which they were created, and they are available in all reports using that same dataset.

To create a bucket, click the **Bucket** icon in the toolbar.

For more information on creating buckets, see [Bucketing Data](../05-Working%20with%20Data/Datasets/03-Analyze/buckets.md).
