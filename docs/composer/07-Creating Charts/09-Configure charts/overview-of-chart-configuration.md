On the right side of your screen, you have the Configuration Panel where you can choose the type of chart as well as adjust styles and apply different features to your chart.

The options and settings for each chart will vary slightly, depending on the chart type you choose. 

## Chart Types
There are different types of charts or visualizations you can work with. A bar chart will be selected by default but you can choose to start with a different type - simply pick the chart you need from the **Charts** area.

After dropping columns on the canvas, you can easily change to another chart type if you see it suits you better. 

>**Note**: The chart configuration options are briefly described here and explained in more detail in each chart type article. More important features may have their dedicated articles. Links to the relevant articles are provided when necessary.

## Configuration Options
The chart configuration options vary among chart types and are described in detail in the articles for each chart type. However, a comprehensive list of all configuration options, along with a brief description of each and a reference to the charts that they apply to, are given in the next articles in this section. These have been grouped in articles that are named after all possible sections under the Configuration panel and appear in alphabetical order. Some sections in the Configuration panel may not be available for certain chart types.
