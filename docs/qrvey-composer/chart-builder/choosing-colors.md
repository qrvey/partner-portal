If you want your data to truly engage your audience and help them read the visualization in a faster and more effective way, add color to your charts. 

In the **Styles** section, you will be able to change the color of the chart, turn on/off-axis labels, and find other options that vary from chart to chart. 

In the case of some charts, you can decide whether you want to set a single color for the elements on the chart by opening the color picker; if you want to use a different color for each category using one of the predetermined themes, while with other charts you can change the color of their metric components (for example, a needle, a bullet). To read more about setting color styles for different charts, go to the <a href="/docs/qrvey-composer/chart-types/overview">Chart Types article</a> and check the Styles section of a specific chart.
