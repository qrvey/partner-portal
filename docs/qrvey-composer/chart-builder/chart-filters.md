While building your chart, you are able to create and apply the so-called *Internal* or *Chart FIlters*.
These filters will be retained in all instances of the chart across the entire application. To add a filter click on **Add Filters**.

You will see the selected values in the filter panel. This is a hidden filter that is not shown and cannot be edited outside of the chart. To edit or remove this filter, you will need to click on the option in the three-dot menu of the chart to **Edit** the chart first and then edit the filter.

You can edit your chart at any time by clicking on the three-dot menu in the lower-right corner of the panel and selecting **Edit**. Your custom view charts can quickly be filtered to meet your needs. You can remove a panel from this location as well.
