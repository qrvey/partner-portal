If you were given a login email address and a password to access your account, enter them at this point here.

## Signing Up

In case you haven’t received any credentials, click on **Sign Up** to create your Qrvey account using your email address and create a password.

The *Sign Up* option might have been disabled by the administrator.  If this option doesn’t appear on the page, please contact your Qrvey Administrator to enable sign-up or to add your account manually. 

## Signing Out

To sign out of the Qrvey application, go to the menu next to your email address or your display name in the upper-right corner of the application and choose **Logout** from the drop-down menu.

If you have misplaced your password, you can easily recover it using your email address. From the login page, click the **Forgot Password** link, which will bring you to the screen below.

## Single Sign-On: OpenID

Alternatively, you may also use a single sign-on. In order to use this option for logging in, your Admin needs to have this option enabled in the *Admin Center*. Once it is active, you will see the **Log In with OpenID** button on the login screen and you will be able to sign in with your site credentials.
