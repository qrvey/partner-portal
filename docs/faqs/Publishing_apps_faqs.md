**Q: I published a page (or an application), but when I click the link to see the page and share it with a user, a message appears saying the page is not available.**

A: Navigation has to be added for a page to show up. Click on the navigation tab and add the page that you wish to share to the right. The page will now be available upon publishing the application from the URL that is accessible from the link icon.
    
**Q: I have filters on my page that I see in the side panel of the page builder, but they donâ€™t show up for my end users when I publish the application.**

A: In order to enable the side panel for your end-users, you have to insert the filter panel on your page from the **Insert** menu in the top-left corner of the page builder.
