## Send Email
Use the **Send Email** action to send notifications and alerts via email. To use this action enter a comma delimited list of email addresses and provide a subject and a message. The message body can be formatted with any of the formatting tools provided, including bold, italic and underline. There are also justification and list options.

In the lower-right corner you’ll find the **Insert / Attach** menu that provides a number of different items you can add to your message. These include a link to any active web form; the results of any web form; the details of a specific response; or a file that you specify.

If you choose the **Insert Report** option you can generate a custom report for any web form. Just select the form type and name and give your report a name. You can then select the filtering, sorting, and exclusion items you'd like, along with a limit on the number of rows you'd like to return. Finally, you may select either HTML or CSV as your output format. When you are happy with your selections, click **Generate Report** to return to your Flow.

## Send SMS
The **Send SMS** action is similar to **Send Email** in that you can send notifications and alerts, only this time via SMS text message. Just provide any valid mobile phone number, then type in your message up to 140 characters.

Any attachments you include in your message will be sent as links that your recipient can click on to open the attachment in their web browser.

## Fillable PDF
The Fillable PDF action allows you to use a PDF template from the File Manager and populate the predefined fields with data from a web form or dataset. 

After choosing this action, simply select the PDF template you'd like to use, then map each of the fields you'd like to populate with the appropriate data. Fields left blank will not be populated.
