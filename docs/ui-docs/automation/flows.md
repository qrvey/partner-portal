A Flow is a series of elements that work together to perform a task. They can be used to automate just about anything in Qrvey, adding power and flexibility to your applications. In this article, we’ll discuss the three main components of a Flow as well as how to create one.

## Components
Flows consist of three elements:

 **Triggers / Schedules** - an event that begins a flow.
 **Actions** - the work that gets done when the trigger is initiated.
 **Conditions** - filters that can include or exclude actions from happening.

For example, you may have a simple Flow that says, when a new response is received (trigger) send me an alert email (action). Or you may choose to send a follow-up survey (action) when a for response is received (trigger) but only if the respondent is from the U.S. (condition). These are just two basic examples of Flows in action. There are hundreds of possible use cases and Flows that you are able to create.

## Creating a Flow
To create a Flow, choose **Flows** from the left-hand menu and then click the **Create Flow** button

Give your new Flow a name and description, then click **Create**

You’ll now be placed in the Flow design area, where you can begin to build your Flow. The Flow designer consists of a blank canvas on the left and a tray with all of the elements you’ll need on the right. 

Start by clicking on any trigger and dragging it onto your canvas. Components will automatically be run from from top to bottom on the page. Below your trigger, you can add conditions and actions to complete your Flow. Changes are saved automatically as you build.

## Flow Activity Log
Every Flow keeps a log of all its activity, including any changes made by creators and every time the Flow is triggered.  If you ever have questions about how your Flow is performing, the activity log is the place to see detailed information about it’s activities, errors and events. 

To access the activity log, click the **Activity** link in the top blue toolbar. The activity log can be searched and filtered to make finding relevant events easier.
