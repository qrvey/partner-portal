Tokens are parameters or variables which act as containers for data. Tokens can be categorized into System, Data or User-Defined and can be used across different contexts in the application. 

## Types of Tokens
**System Tokens:** Standard and provided by the system.
User-Defined Tokens: Custom tokens defined by users in the context they are in.
**Data Tokens:** Automatically generated from the rows/columns within a dataset and used to reference values from the data.
**User-Defined Tokens:** Tokens created by you. Can be text, numeric or date formats

## Tokens Suggestion Box
The suggestion box is a guide to show which tokens are available. It can be accessed by typing two curly brackets **{{** into the text field where you want to use a token. The tokens that are available for that specific context will be shown in the corresponding drop-down list.

From this box you can also access the Tokens Management Modal by clicking on **Add/Manage Tokens**

## Token Management
This view will show the available tokens grouped into two tabs. Each token can be given a name, value and optionally, an alias for easy reference and a description.  The User Defined tab is where you can create and manage your own list of token.

In the Data tab, youâ€™ll find tokens automatically generated for every field in your connected datasets. You can add shorter aliases to any or all of these fields as needed.
