Qrvey has two different embedding options available if you'd like to display your web form on a website, blog, web or mobile application. 

## iFrame
The simplest method for embedding is to use an **iFrame**, which essentially just creates a small window on your website that points directly to your web form. 

To add an iFrame, navigate to the **Publish** tab of your web form and click **iFrame** to copy the provided code. Then paste the code to your external application.

## In-Context Embedding
The second option for embedding your form is selecting **In-Context.** Using this method, you must first select your embedding options in the **Customize** tab and this code will activate the in-context tab on your page.
