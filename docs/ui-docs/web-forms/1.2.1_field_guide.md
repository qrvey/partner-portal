Qrvey’s Web Forms offer a wide variety of question and field types to make sure you have the right tool for the job. In this guide, we’ll list all of the available types and explain how to use each one. 

**Note**: Not all question and field types are available in all Web Forms.

## Address (Global)
The Address field allows for the entry of international addresses and includes a county selector drop-down menu.

## Address (US)
The US Address field allows for the input of a valid address in the US and includes city, state and zip code fields, but does not include a country selector.

## Date
Date questions allow your respondents to enter a date as their answer. They will be provided with a simple date picker to make their selection quickly and accurately. You also have the ability to add a date range, if desired, to require users to only enter dates within a specific timeframe. If you select a date range, a note will be provided to your users, letting them know what the required range is.

## Dropdown
The Dropdown field allows respondents to choose from a predefined list of options in a familiar dropdown list format. You may either type in your choices, cut and paste them from another source, or choose from one of the prebuilt lists provided on the right. Additionally, you have the option to provide an “Other” field where respondents can type in their own value. You may use the Clear All link to remove all of the existing options.

## Email
The email field automatically validates that a valid email address has been entered and will not let the respondent proceed without one.

## Expression
Expression questions are a great way to determine how a respondent feels about a certain topic by letting them choose up to three words from a predetermined list that you provide.

Start by entering your question, then adding the words you’d like your respondents to choose from. Separate words by using commas or the space bar.

If you choose to Activate categories your word list will be divided into “positive” and “negative” categories. Your respondents will first choose whether they feel good or bad about your question, then choose from only the words in that category.

## Image
Image questions allow respondents to select one or more images from a list. You can provide 2 to 15 images for the user to select from, and specify if multiple selections are allowed. You may upload or link to any JPG, GIF or PNG image. The preferred image dimensions are 420x250 pixels and all images will be scaled to fit those dimensions. Images can be uploaded from your local computer or you can provide a link to any image you find online.
Once you’ve uploaded your images, be sure to give each option a name below the image.

## Image Upload
Image Upload allows respondents to take a photo or attach an existing image to their forms and surveys. The supported image formats include JPG, GIF or PNG.

Once the image is uploaded, you have the option of analyzing it in one of two ways. **Object** analysis looks at the image and identifies items and objects, while **Text** analysis looks for characters and words within the image.  In both cases, the image will be tagged with the items or words discovered and those tags can be used in your analytics and automation.

As with all machine learning functions, object and text analysis are not exact sciences, so treat them accordingly.

## Lookup
The Lookup field allows the user select one, or multiple, items from a list populated from a data sources. The data source can be another web form, spreadsheet, live connection, or external data source. 

![9_field-guide](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.qrvey.com/documentation_assets/ui-docs/web-forms/3.4.1.2_field-guide/9_field-guide.png#thumbnail-80)

## Multiple Choice
Multiple Choice questions allow users to select one, or multiple, items from a predefined list of up to 15 choices. To begin, type your question in the box provided, add a description if desired, then enter at least two answer choices. 

Multiple Choice can also be used to have users look at an image, then select a correct answer(s) from the provided options. Click **Add Image** if you’d like to add an image to your question. 

To add additional items, click the **+** icon. You may also choose to allow multiple selections or randomize the answers by selecting the appropriate boxes. Adding an **Other** option will allow users to type in their own answers up to 100 characters in length.

If your web form is a survey, multiple choice questions also support branching. Click **+ Add Branch** to add branching options to your multiple choice question.

## Name
The Name field is a simple text area for respondents to enter their first and last name as shown below.

![12_field-guide](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.qrvey.com/documentation_assets/ui-docs/web-forms/3.4.1.2_field-guide/12_field-guide.png#thumbnail)

## Numeric
Numeric questions allow you to ask questions that require a simple numeric answer. Qrvey offers a few numeric options to ensure respondents enter their numbers in the format you’re looking for.

In the first drop-down menu, you can choose the type of number you’re looking for. **General** allows for digits without comma separators (ie: zip codes). **Number** will automatically insert comma separators. **Currency** automatically adds a dollar sign and two decimal places to respondent answers. **Percentage** will add a percent sign (%).

If you’d like your numeric responses to be contained within a specific range, click the **Select Range** dropdown and choose from the options of **Less Than**, **More Than** or **Between**. Depending on the selection you choose, one or two additional boxes will appear so you can set the values you require. 

**Note**: If you choose to include a numeric range, a note will be provided to your users letting them know what the required range is.

Finally, you may choose whether or not to allow decimal values.  For numeric answers like zip codes, you may prefer to disable decimals.  Once enabled, there will be no limit to the number of decimals a respondent may provide.

## Password
The Password field allows respondents to enter an encrypted password. The password field hides the password as it is being typed and will be saved as an encrypted hash. You will not have access to the password itself, only the hash.

You can choose to have the respondent enter their password twice for verification and choose the minimum and the maximum number of characters you’d like to allow.

![14_field-guide](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.qrvey.com/documentation_assets/ui-docs/web-forms/3.4.1.2_field-guide/14_field-guide.png#thumbnail)

## Phone
The Phone Number field requires respondents to enter a valid 10-digit phone number.

![16_field-guide](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.qrvey.com/documentation_assets/ui-docs/web-forms/3.4.1.2_field-guide/16_field-guide.png#thumbnail)

## Ranking
Ranking allows your respondents to order a list of items using a simple drag-and-drop motion. To build a ranking question, just type in the options you’d like your respondents to choose from. For the most unbiased results, your options should be as random as possible.

![17_field-guide](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.qrvey.com/documentation_assets/ui-docs/web-forms/3.4.1.2_field-guide/17_field-guide.png#thumbnail-80)

## Rating
Rating questions show your respondents a familiar five-star scale from which they can choose between one and five stars.

![18_field-guide](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.qrvey.com/documentation_assets/ui-docs/web-forms/3.4.1.2_field-guide/18_field-guide.png#thumbnail)

## Signature
The signature field allows you to capture a digital signature on your forms and surveys. Respondents will sign with their finger or mouse depending on the device they’re using.

![19_field-guide](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.qrvey.com/documentation_assets/ui-docs/web-forms/3.4.1.2_field-guide/19_field-guide.png#thumbnail-80)

## Slide Bar
Slide bars allow your respondents to choose their answer on a sliding scale. They are best used for ordinal questions that gauge “how much” a person agrees or disagrees with your question. This is an example of what your respondents will see:

![20_field-guide](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.qrvey.com/documentation_assets/ui-docs/web-forms/3.4.1.2_field-guide/20_field-guide.png#thumbnail-60)

Building a slide bar is easy. Simply type in your question, along with the values for the two endpoints. You can then choose how many steps you’d like between the lowest and highest value.

## Text (Long)
For those times when the 120 characters of a short text question is just not enough, you can choose a Long Text question type that will allow for up to 500 character answers.

![22_field-guide](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.qrvey.com/documentation_assets/ui-docs/web-forms/3.4.1.2_field-guide/22_field-guide.png#thumbnail)

## Text (Short)
Hear what your respondents have to say in their own words by using the Short Text question type. Similar to a text message or tweet, short text answers are limited to just 120 characters.

![23_field-guide](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.qrvey.com/documentation_assets/ui-docs/web-forms/3.4.1.2_field-guide/23_field-guide.png#thumbnail)

## Yes / No
Yes/No questions are similar to multiple choice, except that they only offer two answers. You can modify what those choices are, but you’re limited to just the two. If you need the Other field, multiple selections or more answer options, then a multiple choice question would be a better option.
Yes/No questions also support branching in surveys.
