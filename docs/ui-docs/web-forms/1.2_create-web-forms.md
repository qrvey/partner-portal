In this document, we’ll discuss the basics of building a web form and working with our various field and question types. 

## Starting From Scratch
After you first choose which type of web form you want to create, you’ll find yourself in the Design tab of the web form builder. In this tab, you’ll define the structure of your form. You’ll also see tabs along the top for Customize, Publish and Analyze, all of which you’ll use later in the building process.

To begin, start by giving your form a name and description and choose whether to allow users to save their partial answers and come back at a later time to complete their submission.

## Adding Content To Your Web Form
Once you’ve completed the top section, you can then begin adding content to your web form. You may add fields or questions, depending on which type of web form you’re building, or group those fields into sections with the **Add Section** option.

You also have the options to **Add Text** such as instructions between sections or fields. You may also add an introduction page to your web form if you’d like users to read things like instructions before they begin.

# Reordering Fields
You can quickly reorder the questions and fields in your web forms just by clicking and dragging on the reorder icon as shown below.

# Field Status
You also have the option of making your questions and fields Required, Optional or Hidden.  The field’s current state will be displayed in orange in the upper-right corner and you can change the status in the lower-right menu. **Required** fields must be completed before the respondent will be allowed to submit the form. **Optional** fields may be skipped or left blank. **Hidden** fields are shown only to you as the form’s creator, but not to any respondent completing the form.

# Other Options
Also in the lower-righthand menu are options for duplicating and deleting a field, both of which come in handy from time to time.

# Archiving Fields
When initially designing your web form, you may make whatever changes you’d like. However, once your web form has been activated and data has been collected, you will not be able to delete any existing fields. You are able to archive them, which is the next best thing. 

On the **Publish** tab, first pause your web form, then click back to the **Design** tab.  You’ll now see an **Archive** link in the menu options.

Archiving fields will remove them from all pages, reports and workflows where they appear, and also on all analytic pages, so be sure you’re not using the field somewhere else before you archive it.

All of your archived fields are not gone forever, they appear in a link in the upper-right corner of the design tab.

Clicking on this link will allow you to restore any archived field.
