You can customize web forms to fit the look and feel of your brand, as well as configure how they get embedded into your website or application. In this article we’ll discuss the options available inside Qrvey Composer. 

## Application Settings
Inside the **Settings** area of your applications, you’ll find basic options for setting the look and feel of your web forms.

Here you can choose between a light or dark theme, and set the primary color for the elements within your web forms, like titles and action buttons.

## Web Form Settings
Inside each of your web forms, you’ll find additional customization settings in the **Customize** menu along the top of the screen.  The customization options may vary depending on the type of web form you’ve chosen. In the example below, we’re customizing a form, which provides us with options for one or two-column layouts and label positioning. 

The right-hand part of the screen displays a live preview of your web form, so you can see what your users will see when working with your form.

The customization menu consists of two tabs. The second tab is the **In-Context View** tab. This view creates a small slide-out tab that users can open when they want to provide feedback, for example.

The **In-Context** tab comes with its own customization options, including the title and label for your tab and its position.

Finally, if you’d like your tab to open automatically, you can also define the trigger time.  To not have a trigger time, set the seconds to zero.
