Qrvey makes it easy to publish your web forms just about anywhere. In this article, we’ll discuss the different ways you can use your forms, surveys, quizzes and checklists.  

**Note**: Before you can use or share any web form, you must first activate it by clicking the **Activate** button at the top of the publish page. To pause and make changes to your web form, you will need to click the **Pause** button.

## Publishing within Qrvey Applications
The most common place you’ll find Qrvey web forms is inside of Qrvey applications.  Web forms play a crucial part in Qrvey apps and are the primary way users interact with them.  Web Forms can be added to both **Page Builder** and **Report Builder** and also inside of **Workflows** to become a powerful part of your automation.

### Workflows
You can send a web form to a user by choosing **Send Web Form** from the action dropdown list. Web forms can automatically be sent via email or SMS text message and you can even automatically follow-up with people who have not responded.

### Page Builder/Report Builder
You can drag and drop any active web form into a page or report, by selecting it in the tool palette, then positioning it on the page.

## Shareable URL
If you’d like to share your web form outside of Qrvey, the shareable URL is the easiest way to distribute it. First, navigate to the **Publish** tab of your web form.

## Embedding Options
Qrvey has two different embedding options available if you’d like to display your web form inside a website, blog, web or mobile application. The simple method is to use an **iFrame**, which essentially just creates a small window on your website that points directly to your questions. Just click **iFrame** and then copy and paste the code provided.
