For data analysis, we have different options that allow users to work with more complex data types, such as images, long texts or files, by making additional metadata available as column values which can be used in chart creation. 


# Working with Complex Data Types

To start, create a form that contains any of the complex data types we support. In <i>Web Forms</i>, select Form or Survey and add an image upload, file upload, short text or long text field.

Once you publish your Web Forms and responses come in, you can access the chart builder where you will be able to select the fields in your form to create charts using complex data. 

In the example below, a long text field is added as a category. Click on the dot menu to see the metadata options that are available. In the case of long text, you can use <i>Words and Keyphrases</i> to create charts that display the most recurring words/keyphrases in the text. You can also use <i>Sentiment</i> which will display a positive vs negative visualization. Entities will reference unique names of real-world objects such as people, places, and commercial items.
