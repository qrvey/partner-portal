Branching is a powerful feature allows you to ask follow-up questions based on the answer a respondent chooses from a previous question.

For example, if you ask “How are you feeling today?” with the choices for “Good” and “Bad”, you may want to ask different questions based on the respondent’s mood. Branching is currently available for most survey and form question types, excluding payment and passwords. 

**Note**: Branching is available for all survey and form field types where applicable. For example, branching is not available for fields such as  passwords.

# Adding Branches
To create a branch, add your questions and answer choices, then check the **+Add Branch** link in the lower righthand corner.

In the next section, you will give your branch a name, choose the answers for which it should apply and then choose what you would like to happen next.  In the example below, we’ve named our branch the “Great” branch and will assign it to the answer “Great” from the question above.

From the dropdown menu, we can now choose whether respondents should move onto the next question (Follow branch), end the survey (End now) or jump to another point in the survey (Jump to).

## Nested Branching
Qrvey currently allows up to five levels of branching for more complicated question structures.

## Jump Logic
Within any of your branches, you can add jump logic to move a respondent to a different question within your survey or form. From the dropdown menu, just look for the question you’d like respondents to jump to. 

You also have the option to end the survey or form immediately by selecting **End** or after all of the questions in the current branch have been answered as shown below.

## Deleting Branches
To delete a branch, look for the three dot icon in the lower righthand corner of the branch you’d like to delete, then choose **Delete**. Note that deleting a branch will delete all of the questions and logic within that branch.
