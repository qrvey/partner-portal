The Lookup field type offers a number of different options for populating your answer choices. In this article we’ll outline the available options.

## Web Forms
You can select any active Qrvey form or survey to populate your answers. After selecting your web form, you can choose your display and value columns from the available fields. If there are records present in your form, sample data will be displayed below your selections to confirm you’ve made the correct choices.

You can add additional display columns by clicking the **+** button to the right of the value column. To remove an extra display column, just click the **X** next to the column name.

## Spreadsheets
Your lookup can also be populated from spreadsheet data. You can select any uploaded CSV file by selecting **Spreadsheet** and then the file. The process works the same as it does for web form data.

## External Connections
Finally, External Connections allows you to use any additional connection you’ve made in the **Datasets** area. To add an existing connection, you will need to select the data source, database and a table/view. Once selected, you can choose your display and value columns.
