Qrvey has three different types of web forms available for collecting and updating information. In this article weâ€™ll briefly look at each type, to provide a brief overview and outline when best to use them.

## Form
Forms allow you to collect and update information like names, addresses, phone numbers and emails and are the go-to choice for most applications. They offer a variety of question types and their analytics include a tabular, spreadsheet-like view of your data. 

Forms also include some unique features, like sections and columns, which allow you to display your forms in multiple columns and across multiple pages to make data input more user friendly.  Forms include the following templates:

## Survey
If your application requires branching, or the ability to ask different questions based on the responses received, then Survey is the right choice. 

Surveys ask questions one at a time, which makes branching possible.  You can include a variety of question and field types in your survey and analytics can be presented either in a tabular or summary view with visualizations depending on your analysis needs. Surveys have a variety of templates available in various categories.

## Quiz
Quizzes are a fun way to gather feedback and test knowledge. With quiz, you can assign points to each question and designate the correct answer(s). The output of a quiz is a leaderboard which will rank all of your respondents based on how they did. You can also analyze quiz results in aggregate.
