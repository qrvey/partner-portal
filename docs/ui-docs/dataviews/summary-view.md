Every dataset connected to Qrvey will automatically generate a Summary View, which provides a quick look into your data. To access the summary view, just navigate the web form or dataset with the data you want to review and click the Analyze tab.

The summary view provides a panel for each column or field in your data, offering different summary information levels, depending on the field type. As shown in the example below, bar charts are used to summarise the three numeric fields. The visualizations will vary according to the column/field type.

In the upper-right corner of each panel, you’ll find options to apply filters and download any individual panel in JPG, PDF, or CSV format.

These same download options are also available in the upper-right corner of the page, except here, you will receive the entire page instead of an individual panel.

Also, in the upper-right corner, you’ll find options to add **Formulas** and **Bucketing**, which are discussed in other articles, and **Filtering**, which is described below.

## Filtering
You can apply filters to any summary panel by clicking the filter icon; It will bring up a filter dialog box to select the column and define the conditions and values to refine the data. Filter options will vary depending on the field type of the panel. All filter changes are immediately applied to the summary view.

All of the created filters are displayed in the Filters panel on the right side of the page. Here, some or all of your filters can be quickly enabled or disabled. Use the **Reset All** link to remove all filters from the summary view.
