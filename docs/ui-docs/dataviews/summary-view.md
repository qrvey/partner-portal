Every dataset connected to Qrvey will automatically generate a **Summary View**, which provides a quick look into your data. To access summary view, just navigate to the web form or dataset, then click the **Analyze** tab.

Summary view provides a panel for each column or field in your data, providing different levels of summary information depending on the field type. In the example below, you’ll see bar charts for three numeric fields, but the visualizations and information display will vary.

In the upper-right corner of each panel, you’ll find options to apply filters and also to download any individual panel in JPG, PDF or CSV formats.

These same download options are also available in the upper-right corner of the page, only here you will receive the entire page, as opposed to an individual panel.

Also in the upper-righthand corner you’ll find options to add **Formulas** and **Bucketing**, which are discussed in other articles, and **Filtering**, which is discussed below.

## Filtering
You can apply filters to any summary panel by clicking the filter icon. This will bring up a filter dialog box. The exact filter options will vary depending on the field type of the panel. All filter changes are immediately applied to summary view.

All of the applied filters are aggregated in the **Filters** panel on the right side of the page. Here, some or all of your filters can be quickly enabled or disabled. Use the **Reset All** link to remove all filters from summary view.
