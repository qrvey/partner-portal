The following chart types are currently supported by Qrvey. The list is sorted in alphabetical order of the chart type and provides use cases and details about each type.
Metrics have their own section at the end of this document.

## Bar Chart
### Overview
The bar chart presents categorical data with rectangular bars that show heights or lengths in proportion to the values they represent. The bars can be plotted vertically or horizontally.

### When to Use Bar Charts
Bar charts are best suited to compare data between different groups or categories. They are also used to track changes over time.

#### Use Cases
* To show the amount/percentage of a population that attends different types of events during a period of time.

### How to Use Bar Charts
Inside Qrvey, there are different sections where you can create a Bar Chart. For the purpose of this guide, we will use the Chart Builder where a user can create different types of charts. For a general overview of the Chart Builder, please check

## Box & Whiskers Chart
### Overview
A Box & Whisker chart presents information from a five-number summary. It is especially useful for indicating whether a distribution is skewed and whether there are any potentially unusual observations or outliers in the data set. Box & Whisker charts are also very useful when large numbers of observations are involved and when two or more data sets are being compared.
This chart is used to show the shape of the distribution, its central value, and its variability.

### When to Use It
Box & Whiskers are commonly used in exploratory data analysis. Works to make comparisons between records of different time periods.

### Use Cases
* To compare distributions because the center, spread and overall range are immediately apparent.
* To summarize a set of data measured on an interval scale. 

### How to Use It

## Crosstab Chart
### Overview
A crosstab is a data summarization tool that allows structuring, summarizing, and displaying large amounts of data. It is most commonly used to analyze the multiple measures in multiple dimensions at the same time. A crosstab can display totals and subtotals for columns and rows, and it allows users to rearrange the measures and dimensions to get a different view of the data.

### When to Use Crosstab Charts
Crosstabs are commonly used when there are a limited number of categories. The row and column variables in a crosstab can be used interchangeably. The choice of row/column variable is usually dictated by space requirements or interpretation of the results.
Crosstabs are commonly used when you want to create quick reports efficiently, allowing you to analyze the data and arrive at quick decisions. They are also helpful when you want to run online analysis by expanding and collapsing levels of data to focus your results, and drilling down to details from the summary data for areas that interest you.

### Use Cases
* To represent and analyze many categorical variables or nominal measurement scale data.
* For financial reporting.
* To segment data by different variables and calculate totals.
* When the data needs to be aggregated, and sliced for analysis. 

### How to Use Crosstab Charts
In Qrvey Composer, there are different places where you can create a Crosstab Chart. For the purpose of this guide, we will use the Chart Builder with which users can create different types of charts.

## Heatmap
### Overview
Heatmaps visualize data through variations in color, providing an easy-to-understand overview of data. Applied to a tabular format, Heatmaps are good at showing relationships between two variables or revealing patterns. Each cell of the matrix created represents the value of a measure for the intersection of the selected category. The colors represent where the value falls in the range of the measure with darker colors indicating higher values and lighter colors indicating lower ones.

### When to Use It
Heatmap charts are commonly used to display a more generalized view of numeric values. Especially in cases when the user is dealing with large volumes of data, as colors are easier to distinguish and make more sense than raw numbers.

#### Use Cases
* To showcase âhot and coldâ zones or data in a table.
* To draw attention to trends.

### How to Use It
Inside Qrvey Composer, there are different places where you can create a Heatmap chart. For the purpose of this guide, we will use the Chart Builder where a user can create different types of charts.

On the right side of the window, we can find the properties panel. The first section is related to chart type selection, where a user can select which type of chart they want to create. Here, we will choose the Word Cloud chart.


![32_chart_types](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.qrvey.com/documentation_assets/ui-docs/dataviews/Chart+Types/32_ct.png#thumbnail-40) 

After selecting the Word cloud chart, the center of the chart builder window will update to reflect the actions required.




At the top of the chart builder, there are 2 fields for *Category* and *Values*. In these fields, you can drag and drop columns from your data panel located on the left side. In the middle section, you can set the title and a description for the chart. Finally, the Word cloud will be displayed on the canvas once at least one column is dropped as a category or value.


![33_chart_types](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.qrvey.com/documentation_assets/ui-docs/dataviews/Chart+Types/33_ct.png#thumbnail) 

### Properties
Charts have a set of properties that allows users to customize the aspect of the chart, modifying its look, format, and behavior along with some other options. The properties panel located on the right side of the window shows different sections for chart settings.

In this section, you will find a guide through the settings specific for the Word Cloud chart.

#### General
* **Sort by**: When enabled, users can sort the values of the column.
* **Tooltips**: Turn on/off tooltips of each data point.
* **Max Data Point**: Set the maximum number of Words in the chart.



## Tables
### Overview
Tables simultaneously show multiple fields directly from your data source in a raw format with the content of each row being logically connected. An unlimited number of grouped and aggregated columns can be accepted allowing users rapid access and relatively easy comparison of data.

### When to Use It
Tables are best suited for running detailed analysis and precise values instead of visualization of values.

#### Use Cases
* When you need the display to look up individual values.
* To compare individual values but not an entire series of values to one another.
* When precise values are required.
* When the quantitative information to be communicated involves more than one unit of measure.
* To include both, summary and detailed values.

###Â How to Use It
Inside the Qrvey Composer, there are different places where you can create a table. For the purpose of this guide, we will use the Chart Builder with which users can create different types of charts.

To get started, open the chart builder, and a new window will open up in the center of the screen, as shown below.

![34_chart_types](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.qrvey.com/documentation_assets/ui-docs/dataviews/Chart+Types/34_ct.png#thumbnail) 

On the right side of the window, we will find the properties panel. The first section is related to chart type selection, where users can select which type of chart they want to create. Here, we will choose the Table.


![35_chart_types](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.qrvey.com/documentation_assets/ui-docs/dataviews/Chart+Types/35_ct.png#thumbnail-40) 

After selecting the Table, the center of the chart builder window will update to reflect the actions required.


![36_chart_types](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.qrvey.com/documentation_assets/ui-docs/dataviews/Chart+Types/36_ct.png#thumbnail) 

At the top of the screen (1), there are fields for columns and groups. In these fields, you can drag columns from your data source located on the right side of the window and see them appear as a table column in the middle of the screen. In the middle section (2), you can set the title and a description. Finally, in the middle of the screen (3), is where the table is displayed.


![37_chart_types](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.qrvey.com/documentation_assets/ui-docs/dataviews/Chart+Types/37_ct.gif#thumbnail) 

Users can create two types of tables:

* **Simple**: A user creates a simple table dragging and dropping fields from the data source into the columns section on top of the window, as described in image 3 above. Another way to create a simple table is by dragging and dropping fields into the top table guideline with the label âDrop column as columnâ when the mouse hovers over the table, as described in the image below.


![38_chart_types](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.qrvey.com/documentation_assets/ui-docs/dataviews/Chart+Types/38_ct.gif#thumbnail) 

In the end, a user can review which fields of the data source are part of the table looking at the top of the window in the columns - group section.


![38_chart_types](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.qrvey.com/documentation_assets/ui-docs/dataviews/Chart+Types/38_ct.png#thumbnail) 

If there are duplicate values in any column used in the table, multiple rows will be shown
as duplicate values. In the examples below, the value USA appears twice in the column *country*.

![39_chart_types](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.qrvey.com/documentation_assets/ui-docs/dataviews/Chart+Types/39_ct.png#thumbnail) 

* **Grouped**: A user can create this type of table dragging and dropping columns from the data source in the columns and groups section at the top of the window. In this scenario, the table treats fields in the group section as a pivot and fields left in the column section as aggregated values.


![40_chart_types](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.qrvey.com/documentation_assets/ui-docs/dataviews/Chart+Types/40_ct.gif#thumbnail) 

Another way to create a grouped table is by using the vertical and horizontal guidelines that appear over the chart when the mouse is hovering over it.


![41_chart_types](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.qrvey.com/documentation_assets/ui-docs/dataviews/Chart+Types/41_ct.gif#thumbnail) 

### Properties
Charts have a set of properties that allows users to customize the aspect of the chart, modifying its look, format, and behavior along with some other options. The properties panel located on the right side of the window shows different sections for chart settings.

In this section, you will find a guide through the settings specific for the Table chart.

#### General
In this section, you will find *Menu Actions* and *Max Groups*.

**Menu Actions** allow users to enable or disable table columns options located on the right side of the column name and identified as three dots icons. The three available options are:

* **Sorting**: When enabled, users can sort the values of the column.

* **Visualization**: When enabled, users can change how they want to visualize the values of that column, the first option is as a value (default), and the second option is as bars. 

**Note**: Visualizations are only available for numeric values.

* **Totals**: When enabled, users can aggregate values of the column in two different ways:
  * ***Count***: The table will count how many values there are in that specific column, and the number will be displayed at the bottom of the column.
  * ***Distinct Count***: The number of unique values in the column displayed at the bottom of the column.
	
The following image shows how **Menu Action** settings work.

### Resizing Columns 
You can  manually modify the Column Sizes of Table Charts by simply dragging  hovering over the header of the column and dragging the column headerâs width to the left or right using the marquee tool.

## Metrics

### Overview

Metrics are a powerful feature that allows you to keep an eye on your most important data at a glance. It can be used by itself or it can be used as a part of a page, report, dashboard, or workflow.

### When to Use It
Metrics are best suited for performance, comparative, qualitative, and quantitative measurements.

#### Use Cases
* To highlight performance against one or more benchmarks.

### How to Use It
In Qrvey Composer, there are different places where you can create a table. For the purpose of this guide, we will use the Chart Builder with which users can create different types of charts.

To get started, open the chart builder, and a new window will open up in the center of the screen, as shown below.











To build your first metric, you can access the Chart Builder from the Analyze tab of the dataset youâd like to use, or from the Page and Report Builder. Select the type of metric you would like to build choosing between *Indicator, Bullet* or *Gauge* and drag a value to the shelf or into the drop zone. 

![42_chart_types](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.qrvey.com/documentation_assets/ui-docs/dataviews/Chart+Types/42_ct.png#thumbnail) 

![43_chart_types](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.qrvey.com/documentation_assets/ui-docs/dataviews/Chart+Types/43_ct.png#thumbnail) 

As soon as you add the field, the value will be shown and you can continue to style your metric from the Comparison and Styles section on the right side of the panel. 

You can add time comparison options by dragging a date field to the right-side panel in the Date Column area and selecting a time period to compare with from a series of options such as *Last Hour, Today, This month, Last quarter,* and *This year* amongst others.

In the Comparison section, you can also define the styles for fonts and the change value. You can set colors and symbols for *Increasing/Decreasing Change* and *No Change* which will reflect depending on the data. 

![44_chart_types](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.qrvey.com/documentation_assets/ui-docs/dataviews/Chart+Types/44_ct.png#thumbnail) 

There are other options to control visual aspects and behavior of the metric like the automatic resizing of the content which will readjust itself to the size of the panel when itâs enabled. When itâs turned off, it will take the defined font size. Another available option is to turn on/off the animation used to display the indicator metric while the data is loading. 

![45_chart_types](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.qrvey.com/documentation_assets/ui-docs/dataviews/Chart+Types/45_ct.png#thumbnail-40) 

For Dial and Bullet Gauge style metrics Thresholds can be set. You can choose to provide color-coded ranges for your data. Typically, people use three thresholds for indicating good, bad and in-between ranges for their metrics. You can provide each threshold with a name and assign it a color. 

![46_chart_types](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.qrvey.com/documentation_assets/ui-docs/dataviews/Chart+Types/46_ct.png#thumbnail) 


### Bullet Gauge
The bullet metric is used to compare one or more measures to enrich its meaning and displays it in the context of qualitative ranges of performance, such as poor, satisfactory, or good. The qualitative ranges are displayed as different colors that can be customized.

![47_chart_types](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.qrvey.com/documentation_assets/ui-docs/dataviews/Chart+Types/47_ct.png#thumbnail) 

#### Properties
Metrics have a set of properties that allows users to customize the aspect and modify the look, format, and behavior along with some other options. The properties panel located on the right side of the window shows different sections for metric settings.

In this section, you will find a guide through the settings specific for Metrics.

#### General
* **Legends**: Turn on/off legends. (Dial, Bullet)
* **Tooltips**: Turn on/off tooltips of each data point. (Dial, Bullet)
* **Fixed Scale**: Turn on/off tooltips of each data point. (Dial, Bullet)

### Comparison
* **Date Column**: Add the date column to visualize the comparison value.

#### Styles
* **Color**: Change the colors of the metric.
* **Font Style**: Change the font style of the values. (Indicator)
* **Automatic Resize**: Turn on/off the resizing of the metric in the panel. (Indicator)
* **Circle Resize**: Change the size of the circle. (Dial)
* **Gauge Style**: Change the gauge style. (Dial)
Threshold Opacity: Change the degree of thresholdâs opacity. (Dial, Bullet)
Show Animations:  Turn On/Off the metric animations. 

**Note**: Once turned off, every time a page containing that metric is loaded or new data comes in, the metric will no longer show the default animation.

![49_chart_types](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.qrvey.com/documentation_assets/ui-docs/dataviews/Chart+Types/49_ct.png#thumbnail-40) 



## Dial Gauge
Dial Gauge Metrics use needles to show information as a reading on a dial.
The value for each needle is read against the colored data range or chart axis. This chart type is commonly used in dashboard reports to show key business indicators.
 
 ![50_chart_types](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.qrvey.com/documentation_assets/ui-docs/dataviews/Chart+Types/50_ct.png#thumbnail) 

## Indicator
An indicator is a qualitative or quantitative variable that provides a simple and reliable means to express achievement, the attainment of a goal, or the results stemming from a specific change. It often aggregates or combines a comparison based on different dates.
