**Custom View** allows you to build custom visualizations for your data, which can then be used as part of reports, pages and workflows. Custom View also serves as your own personal dashboard view of what’s most important in your dataset. 

To access Custom View, select from the **Analyze** tab inside your web form or dataset.

## Filtering
You can apply filters to any custom panel by clicking the filter icon. This will bring up a filter dialog box. The exact filter options will vary depending on the field type of the panel. All filter changes are immediately applied to the panel.

All of the created filters are shown in the **Filters** panel on the right side of the page. Here, some or all of your filters can be quickly enabled or disabled. Use the **Reset All** link to remove all filters from the custom view.
