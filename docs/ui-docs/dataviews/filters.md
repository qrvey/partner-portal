Filters allow you to drill down into your data by only selecting rows that meet certain conditions. They can be applied from a number of different places within the analysis areas of Qrvey.  You will find the Filter icon in every analytic view.  

In Tabular view, just look for the filter icon as shown below.

In Summary, Custom and Metric views, filters can be applied from any individual chart panel.

## Adding a Filter
After clicking on the filter icon, the filter window below will appear.  Start by selecting the column you’d like to filter by, then add the condition and value you’d like to filter by and click the **+ Add Filter** button. Applied filters will appear in the pane on the right.

In addition to conditional filters, you can also filter by value by expanding the **Filter by value** pane below the **Filter by condition** pane.

## Showing/Hiding Filters
Once you have created your filters, you can quickly show and hide them from any analytic view by clicking the filter icon in the upper right corner of the application. 

To hide a filter, just uncheck it or use the **Filters** toggle at the top to show/hide all of your filters. You can permanently remove a filter by clicking the **X** next to each filter or clicking **Reset All** to remove all filters.
