You can export data and visualizations from the analyze tab of your dataset. 

## Complete Datasets / Views

In the upper-right corner of the the **Analyze** tab you’ll find the download link, which will allow for the export of your complete, or filtered, dataset in CSV format, or the complete **Summary**, **Custom** or **Metric** view in either JPG or PDF formats. 

**Note**: For larger datasets, it may take up to a few minutes for your CSV download to  generate.

## Individual Panels / Visualizations
In the upper-right corner of each panel inside Summary, Custom and Metric views you’ll also find a download option for each individual panel/visualization. Just as with the complete dataset download, you have options for JPG and PDF formats for visualizations and CSV format for the underlying data.
