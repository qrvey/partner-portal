Metrics are a powerful feature that allows you to keep an eye on your most important data at a glance. It can be used by itself or it can be used as a part of a page, report, dashboard, or workflow. 

With Metric Builder, you can build the three different gauges below

# Building a Metric
To build your first metric, enter your application, click the **Analyze** tab of the dataset you’d like to use and select the Metric View, as shown below. You can then click **Add Metric** to begin.

If you are already familiar with **Chart Builder,** you’ll find the layout below familiar. You can make your selections on the left and your metric will appear on the right in real-time as you construct it. There are three tabs across the top of the panel for metric, thresholds and visualization options.

The **Metric** tab is where you’ll define the data that makes up your metric. You can provide a name and description, then choose the dataset and value column. There are also options for aggregates, time periods and comparison data.

In the **Thresholds** tab, you can choose to provide color-coded ranges for your data. Typically, people use three thresholds to indicate good, bad and in-between ranges for their metrics. You can provide each threshold a name and assign it a color.

Finally, in the **Visualization** tab, you can choose which type of visualization you’d like, and set an additional color, size and display options. These will vary depending on the type of metric you select. Once you are happy with your settings, click **Save** in the lower-right corner and your metric will be added to your dashboard where it can then be used for pages, reports and workflows.
