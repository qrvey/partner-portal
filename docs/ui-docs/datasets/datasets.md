In the **Data Section** you can import or connect to external data, define web forms to capture new data, and link datasets together. The **Data Section** has tabs on the toolbar, corresponding to the four categories of data.  In this article, we’ll outline these four categories.

## Datasets
The **Datasets** tab is where you’ll connect to existing data sources, including MySQL, MS-SQL, and Oracle. You can also choose to add a direct connection to Elasticsearch or you can upload data in CSV format.

## Data Links
In the **Data Links** tab you can combine columns from multiple existing datasets into a single virtual dataset to make your analysis easier and faster. Once created, **Data Link** sources are automatically updated with new data as the underlying datasets change.
