In the Data Section, you can import or connect to external data, define web forms to capture new data, and link datasets together. The Data Section has tabs on the toolbar, corresponding to the four categories of data. In this article, weâ€™ll outline these four categories.

## Datasets
The Datasets tab is where you can create Datasets and see them listed. Each dataset card will indicate the name, created and updated date, and the dataset status. 
In order to create datasets, there need to be existing connections. These connections are created in the Connections tab. Datasets can also be created from already existing datasets. 
The different statuses will indicate if the data was loaded successfully to the dataset and is active and therefore ready to be used for creating visualizations, or if the data is loading and the dataset is in draft state. When the data fails to load, the dataset card will show a red indicator and the status will be shown as Failed.

## Web Forms
Web Forms are great for collecting new data or updating existing data. They are simple to use and can be embedded or shared practically anywhere, including via email or social media. Web form options include Forms, Surveys and Quizzes.

## Data Links
In the Data Links tab, you can combine columns from multiple existing datasets into a single virtual dataset to make your analysis easier and faster. Once created, Data Link sources are automatically updated with new data as the underlying datasets change.

## Connections
The Connections tab is where you can add new connectors and manage your existing data connections, including MySQL, SQL Server, PostgreSQL, and Oracle. You can also create File Upload connections to use data in CSV files.
