When you enter the Connections section for the first time, you will see all the types of connections we support, including SQL Server, MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, File Upload. 

Please go to the documents below to get more information on:

To edit or delete an existing connection, use the three-dot menu in the top-right corner of each card. Editing connections could affect related datasets and cause that data is not reloaded to the dataset. 

Clicking on View Data will pop up a partial view of the data for file upload connections and database connections that have a database and table selected.
