> Pixel-perfect Reports is a new feature currently in *beta* introduced with version 8.1 of the Qrvey platform. Your feedback and ideas are greatly appreciated, as they can help us improve this feature in future releases.

Filters enable you to refine the data that is displayed in the reports. Filters in Pixel-perfect Reports are configured similar to Filters in Qrvey Composer. The only difference is that filters in Pixel-perfect Reports are not applied while the canvas is in Edit mode. The filters are applied when you preview a report. 

To create a filter, display the Filters panel and click **Add Filter**.
