# Filtering Data

Filters enable you to refine the data that is displayed in the reports. Filters in Pixel-perfect Reports are configured similar to Filters in Qrvey Composer. The only difference is that filters in Pixel-perfect Reports are not applied while the canvas is in Edit mode. The filters are applied when you preview a report. 

To create a filter, display the Filters panel and click **Add Filter**. 

For more information on configuring filters, see [Introduction to Filters](../filtering-data/introduction.md).
