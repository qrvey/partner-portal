## Overview

While working within the application pages you may have control over the different components and settings inside the page, depending on the permissions granted to you by the composer of the page. For example, you may have the permission to modify the position of the charts as you wish, remove the charts you don’t want to see and change a chart from one type to another. All of these personalizations are available only to you - the person who made the changes - and do not affect the original version of the page, or the personalized versions that any other users may have created for themselves.  You can also revert the changes that you made to a page to see the original content created by the Composer and later jump back to your personalized version at any given moment.

This article describes these personalization options and how they can be performed. 

## Personalizing The Page Layout

In order to change the size or position of the page content, or to add or remove content, click on the three-dot menu at the bottom-right corner of the page. This exposes all possible options - usually, the options to **Download** the page, **Restore Original**, **Edit**, or the **X** icon to close the menu. 

Clicking the **Edit** icon will take you to the edit mode, where you can move panels around, resize them, remove any chart from the page, or choose other charts from under any dataset to add to the page. The options of adding and removing filters, as well as downloading each chart or the entire page, are also available in this mode. 

Once you are done with editing the page you can either save your new, personalized version by clicking on the **Save** icon on the bottom-right corner of the page or discard your changes by exiting the edit mode without saving.

## Personalizing The Charts

If you want to personalize any of the charts, simply click on the dotted menu at the corner of the chart panel to find and click on the **Edit** option. This action opens the Chart Builder/Editor where you can change your chart’s configuration or even its type.

## Personalizing The Filters

New filters can be added and existing ones can be modified either from the filter access point or the chart panels in edit mode or the interaction mode. These filters will be saved to your personalized version and only affect your analytics. Every time you log back into the application, you will see your saved filters.

## Going Back To The Original Version

If you want to restore the original version of the page, simply click on the dotted menu to find the **Restore Original** option. This action reverts the page to the version that was created by the Composer. You can always go back to your personalized version by repeating the same action.

## Other Personalization Features

Any option that is used on the page either affects your personalized version or takes it into consideration. For instance, using the **fit to size** icon on the chart panel - where applicable - changes the settings of the chart panel and the new settings are stored as part of your personalized version. Also, any download, either from the chart panel or the entire page, will be of your personalized version of the page and with your own filters applied.
