**Page Builder** makes it easy to combine multiple Qrvey components, like forms, charts and metrics, into beautiful web pages, each with their own unique URL you can share. You can also combine multiple pages into a complete information application by using navigation, which is discussed  in another article.

To begin building a page, click the page builder icon on the left navigation bar and you will be brought to the page building canvas.

Along the top of the main canvas area, you’ll find the orange **Create New Page** button on the left, a drop-down menu in the center where you can navigate between pages, and the status of your page (Draft or Published) on the right. You’ll also see a button to show/hide the grid lines on your canvas.

In the blue navigation bar along the top, you’ll also find a button to **Publish Application** and a link button to take you to your application in a new browser window or tab.

**Note**: Your application must be published in order to use the link button. Accessing the URL of an application/individual page that is  not published will display a message to users that the resource is currently unavailable.

## Tool Palette
Along the right side of your canvas, you’ll find the **Tool Palette** where you can configure your page settings and find the elements you can drag onto your canvas to construct your page. The tool palette is comprised of several sections.

In the **Page Info** section, you’ll find areas to give you page a name and description. You’ll also find the unique URL for the specific page you’re working on (as opposed to the application overall. Finally, you’ll find access permissions to set the page as either public or private. If set to private, user’s will need to login before accessing the page.

In the **Page Objects** section, you’ll find basic HTML page elements like text areas, images and buttons. You can click and drag any of these elements to your canvas, reposition and resize them, and change their contents by clicking on them. You’ll also find elements to add a header and footer to your page.

In the **Elements** section you’ll find find components from the rest of your Qrvey application. Any active web forms you have, for example, can be added to your page, as can any reports, metrics or custom charts you’ve built using Chart Builder.

Finally, in the **Filters** section, you can apply filters to any dataset that will be displayed on your page.

## Working with Page Elements
Once you have clicked on an element in the palette and moved it onto your canvas, the tool palette will change to provide more options for the element you’re working with. In the example below, we’re working with a text area, so the palette will display familiar text options for font, size, color, alignment, etc. Click the top-left corner of the element to reposition it, the lower-right corner to drag-to-resize and the right corner to delete.
