The Qrvey logo in the upper-left corner will always return you to this start page. The menu in the upper-right corner provides options to manage your profile, view help documentation and logout as seen below. Your current version of Qrvey is also displayed.

If other Qrvey used have sent applications to you, you’ll find them under the **Received Apps** tab. To install an application, click **Install**.  Use the arrow menu to delete an application or send one to another user on the same Qrvey installation.

The **Activity Log** tab is where you’ll find a history of activity surrounding your applications, such as installations and deletions. The Activity Log can be searched or filtered to quickly find specific events. It can also be downloaded using the **Download Log File** option.

The **Data** section is where you will connect to all of the datasets your applications will be using. **Report Builder** is a wysiwyg tool for building data-driven reports. Use **Page Builder** to build webpages. **Workflows** accesses Qrvey’s data automation engine and allows for 24/7 monitoring of your data.

In the **Settings** section, you can edit your application’s name, customize its look and feel, as well as upload and manage any supporting files it may require. 

Depending on which area of the application you’re using, you will find additional navigation options in the blue toolbar that runs across the top of the application. The orange line shows you the selected menu option.
