<div style="text-align: justify">

A Qrvey application is a self-contained analytic project that can be used  directly, shared, distributed or embedded into other software applications.  Qrvey apps begin with data, but can grow to include any number of analytic components, including charts, reports, web pages, and workflows which work behind the scenes. As an application owner, you can assign users, roles and permissions to your application.

All of the application’s functionality can be accessed using Qrvey’s web interface, but it is also available to developers via API and prebuilt widgets so any portion of the Qrvey platform can be embedded into other applications.

## Components
At a high level, Qrvey offers the following functionality:

* Data Collection - Qrvey has a series of different Web Forms , including forms, surveys, quizzes and checklists, for collecting new information.

* Data Connections - Qrvey connects to existing databases and repositories, including ElasticSearch, SQL-based systems and simple CSV uploads.

* Analytics - All of the data in the forms and datasets listed above can be analyzed using Qrvey’s powerful analytics engine. There are pre-built visualizations that are automatically applied to your data, but you can also build your own with our Chart Builder.

* Page Builder - Creators like yourself can combine all of Qrvey’s components onto web pages to build entire information applications. Individual pages can include any combination of forms, charts, metrics and analytics, as well as standard web components like text, images, headers and footers. These pages can then be combined with navigation and user authentication to make complete, self-contained applications that can be distributed as needed.

* Report Builder - Similar to Page Builder you can combine analytic components to create customizable reports that can be exported on a scheduled basis.

* Automation Workflows - Qrvey has a built-in automation engine that is constantly monitoring your data for changes and updating your charts, metrics and analytics in real-time. These automation services can be used to build workflows for alerts, notifications, data write-backs and countless other data-related tasks.

## Creating Analytic Applications
When creating a Qrvey application, the first thing you will need to do is define the data your application will work with. This can be accomplished by connecting to an existing dataset or by creating a web form that will collect new data.  

In the screenshot below, you’ll see the **Data** section of a Qrvey application, with options for connecting an existing dataset, creating a web form, linking multiple datasets together (**Data Links**) and connectors for legacy data sources.

Once you have created or connected at least one data source, you may then begin accessing other sections of your application such as page builder, report builder and workflows.
