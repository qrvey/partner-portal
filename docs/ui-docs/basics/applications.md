<div style={{textAlign: "justify"}}>

A Qrvey application is a self-contained analytics project that can be used directly, shared, distributed or embedded into other software applications. Qrvey apps begin with data but can grow to include any number of analytics components, such as charts, reports, dashboards, and automated workflows. As an application owner, you can assign users, roles and permissions to your application.

There are several ways to create analytics components within a Qrvey application.  You can leverage the UIs within Qrvey Composer, programmatically create content using the Qrvey APIs, or you can embed multiple widget interfaces within your own application.  Every UI that you use within Qrvey Composer to create analytics content within an application is a fully embeddable, customizable widget.


## Components
At a high level, Qrvey offers the following application components:

* **Web Forms** – Collect data from your users by creating web forms, surveys and quizzes.

* **Data Connections** – Qrvey connects to a wide range of existing RDBMS cloud and on-prem data stores, document databases (such as MongoDB), columnar databases (like Snowflake), REST APIs, and custom JSON and CSV data files.

* **Analytics** – Data can be analyzed using pre-built visualizations that are automatically applied to your data, as well as the ability to create custom charts and metrics.

* **Dashboard Builder** – Dashboards allow composer users to create highly interactive dashboards and mashups of visualizations created across multiple datasets. Individual dashboards can include any combination of forms, charts, metrics and analytics, as well as standard web components like text, images, headers and footers. These dashboards can then be combined with navigation and user authentication to make complete, self-contained applications that can be distributed as needed.

* **Automated Workflows** – Create data-driven  workflows to generate alerts, send notifications, perform data write-backs and send data payloads to external applications.  Workflows can be manually triggered by users within an interactive dashboard, run continuously as a background service, or execute programmatically via an API call.
