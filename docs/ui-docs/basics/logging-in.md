In this document we’ll review logging in and out of the Qrvey Composer application, creating a new account and recovering a lost password. This document does not cover logging into end-user applications.

## Logging In

Navigate to the URL provided by your Qrvey administrator and you’ll be presented with a dialog for logging into Qrvey Composer. If you were given a login email address and password for your account, you can enter them here and proceed to the application.

Alternatively, your Qrvey administrator may have enabled the new account creation feature. If this is the case, you’ll see *I’m new to Qrvey* in the lower-right corner. Click **Sign Up** to create a new account.

## Logging Out

To log out of the Qrvey application, click on the arrow menu adjacent to your display name or email address in the upper right-hand corner of the application. Then choose **Logout** from the drop-down menu.

## Password Recovery

If you have misplaced your password, you can easily recover it using your email address. From the login page, click the **Forgot Password** link, which will bring you to the screen below. Enter your email address and click **Send**. Instructions for recovering your password will be sent to the email provided.

## Single Sign-On: OpenID
Alternatively you may also use a single sign-on. 
In order to use this option for logging in, your Admin needs to have this option enabled in the Admin Center. Once it is active, you will see the **Log In with OpenID** button on the login screen and you will be able to sign in with your site credentials.
