This video provides an in-depth overview of how to securely integrate Qrvey widgets using  JSON Web Tokens (JWT). JWT enables you to encrypt sensitive data, such as your organization’s API access key, logged-in user’s ID and role, as well as sensitive record-level security filters. This video demonstrates how to securely embed the Page View widget in an application using a JWT token, which includes examples of front-end and back-end code. 

Note that the Page View feature was renamed Dashboard View in version 8.0.
