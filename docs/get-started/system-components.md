Qrvey’s analytics platform comprises 4 major components:
1. Admin Portal - For platform management 
2. Data Router - For data ingestion and transformation
3. Analytics Portal - “Qrvey Composer” - Serves the application UI
4. Embedding and API Service 

All of Qrvey components can deploy as a stand-alone application or be embedded into other software applications and platforms through the use of widgets and APIs. 

Below are links to the component sections to help get you started using the Qrvey application. Additional <a href="/docs/video-training/">training videos can be found here</a>.
