## Welcome to Qrvey
Qrvey is an embedded analytics platform serving both internal and external analytics needs for SaaS providers. This getting started section will walk you through the initial deployments and then help you on-board to Qrvey. 

### Deployment
Qrvey is deployed to your AWS environment enabling you to keep the Qrvey system within your desired AWS region and VPC. However, there are instances where certain AWS regions may not have a service available required by the Qrvey system. Refer to our <a href="/docs/get-started/prerequisites-for-installation/" target="_blank"> Prerequisites section</a> for specific details.

Once your region has been verified and you are ready to deploy Qrvey, you can begin ensuring your AWS account is ready by going to the <a href="/docs/get-started/preparing-AWS-account/" target="_blank">Preparing Your AWS Account</a> page.

### Using Qrvey
Once the installation is complete, you will receive an email with instructions on how to log in to your application, your API key, and the javascript file URL used for embedded purposes. We recommend beginning by uploading a sample dataset to begin learning the Qrvey system. <a href="/docs/ui-docs/datasets/data_overview/" target="_blank">This section</a> will guide you through creating your first dataset.

### Support
We are here to help you in any way we can and want your onboarding experience to be successful. If you have any questions or need assistance, please donâ€™t hesitate to reach out to us using <a href="/docs/faqs/ask-us/" target="_blank">the contact form here</a>.
