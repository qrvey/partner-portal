### 
**New Features**


#### 
**Admin Portal**



*   **ADMIN-1662 - Usage Statistics:** We added a section in Account information to show statistics for the Qrvey Composer and Data Router usage. The statistics shown are “Current Plan Status”, “Server Name” for the server that is registered in AWS, “Data Storage” to show how much space has been used by the application on AWS server, “Current Average Storage”, “AWS Server Type”, “Number of Servers”, “Creator Accounts”, “End User Accounts”, and “Created Applications”. 
*   **ADMIN-1669 - Sharing Data Links:** The option to select and add datalinks to the content package to be shared in applications when creating a new application or appending content is now available.

**Data Sources**

*   **QV-9003 - AWS Comprehend:** We replaced IBM Watson text analysis for AWS Comprehend. With this type of  analysis we can display Keywords, Entities, Wordcloud and Sentiment analysis on long or short text columns in Web Forms and Text columns on CSVs. This feature will be available for Elasticsearch and Database Connections datasets next. 

#### 
**Application Building**

*   **AT-4778 - Page Actions - Drill-down:** Creators can enable and set up Drill-drowns for End Users. They can choose to display all columns available in a dataset, or they can choose specific columns to display in order for end users to apply drill-downs. 

#### 
**Data Router**

*   **DR-1247 - Data Sync:** Admins will now have the option to set up data syncing configurations to upload data based on a schedule, overwriting or appending to existing data loaded in the system. 
*   **DR-1248 - Text Analysis Transformation:** This new transformation will allow users to apply different text analysis while uploading data: Keyphrases, Sentiment, Dominant Language and Entities detection using AWS Comprehend.

**Other Enhancements**

*   **AN-7780 - Formula Syntax Using Column Name**: We improved the syntax of formulas by using the column name rather than columns ID which is a series of numbers that made it hard to read. We also color coded the different parts of formulas to allow users to better distinguish the different parts of the formula. 

#### 
**General Tweaks and Bug Fixes**

*   **CSV Exports:** We fixed and removed from exported CSVs the numbers assigned to columns and displayed in headers.

#### 
**Known Issues**

*   **DR-1213- Manifest:** Managing partial files does not update dynamo file status: When ES does a partial insertion from a file, it rejects the rest, and a partial file is created, The manifest process does not handle those partial files, in the DynamoDB table (fileproccesedstatus) if a file generate partial, is marked as failed, with status code 206, once the related partial file is processed, the status of the parent file is not updated, causing the rupture of the manifest upload process.
