## Admin Portal

The Admin Portal is an application to manage your Qrvey instance, Data Router settings, Amazon AWS infrastructure options and application deployments. This document provides information on how to set up your users (creators) and configure their Business Analytics Application tools, how to set up Data Router preferences, create Elasticsearch indexes and do client deployments. 


### Admin Users

Admin users manage the entire Qrvey deployment from the Admin Portal. They can define the access that creators have to the different sections and features of the Business Analytics platform and access all the content from the creators to share applications containing all of the component created or selected components. 

Admins do not manage creator’s content and how they wish to share this with their viewers, or who their viewers are. This is directly managed from the creator’s application (Business Analytics).
