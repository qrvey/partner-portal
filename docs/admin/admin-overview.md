## Admin Portal

Admin Portal is an application to manage your Qrvey instance, Data Router settings, Amazon AWS infrastructure options, and application deployments. This document provides information on how to set up your users (creators) and configure their Business Analytics Application tools, and on how to set up Data Router preferences, create Elasticsearch indexes, and do client deployments. 


## Admin Users

Admin users manage the entire Qrvey deployment from the Admin Portal. They can define the access that creators have to the different sections and features of the Business Analytics platform. They can also access all content from the creators to share applications containing all of the component created or only selected components. 

Admins do not manage a creator's content, or how a creator shares content with their viewers, or define who the viewers are. This is directly managed from the creator's application (Business Analytics).
