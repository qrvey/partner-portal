Solution Architects use the Qrvey Admin Center to manage the infrastructure, users, and content, as well as configure Qrvey Composer.

## Essential Links for the Solution Architect
The primary technical resource for the Solution Architect is the [Qrvey Admin Center User Guide](./introduction-to-qrvey-admin-center.md). 

If youâ€™re new to working with the Qrvey platform as a Solution Architect, start with the following resources:
* [Introduction to the Qrvey Admin Center](./introduction-to-qrvey-admin-center.md)
* [Customizing Qrvey Composer](./customizing-qrvey-composer.md)
* [Managing Users of Qrvey Composer](./managing-users.md)
* [Overview of Content Deployment](./09-Content%20Deployment/overview-of-content-deployment.md)

Another useful resource is the Qrvey [Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)](../faqs.md) page.
