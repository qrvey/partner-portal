The Automation widget enables you to embed the Automation functionality into your application. 

## Before You Begin
* Review the [Widget Quick Start Guide](../overview-of-embedding.md) for an overview of the widget components. 
* Obtain your unique API key. It was provided in the welcome email that your organization received when your Qrvey instance was created. For more information, see [General FAQs](../../../getting-started/faqs.md).

## Get the Helper Code
1. In Qrvey Composer, open the Automation feature. 
2. Click the **Embedding Options** button in the upper right corner of the page, and then click **Embed Automation Widget**. 
3. Click **Copy** to copy the code, and then paste it into your preferred editor. 

## Embed the HTML tag
Identify where you would like this widget to display in your application, and then add the HTML tag in that location. 

The HTML tag for this widget is:
```html
<!-- widget's tag -->
<qrvey-workflow-design settings="config"></qrvey-workflow-design>
```

## Embed the Widget Launcher script tag
Add the widget launcher script tag to your application. 

For reference, the launcher script code is:
```html
<!-- widget's launcher -->
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://<your_qrvey_domain>/widgets-launcher/app.js"></script>
```

## Set properties in the JSON configuration object
Define the JSON configuration object by starting with the script provided in the helper code, and then adding additional configuration properties as needed. The script provided contains only the required properties. For reference, an example is copied below. The helper code that you obtained above should include the unique values indicated with brackets ("&lt;&gt;"), with the exception of the private API key:
```html
<!-- widget's Config Object -->
<script>
var config = {
  api_key: '<API_KEY>',
  domain: 'https://<your_qrvey_domain>',
  user_id: '<USER_ID>',
  app_id: '<APP_ID>'
};
</script>
```
When complete, add the JSON configuration object to your application. 

### Configuration Object Properties
The following table lists the properties associated with this widget. 

| **Property** | **Value** | **Required** |

| **api_key** | `String`, Your organizationâ€™s unique API key required to access the Qrvey platform. | Yes |
| **domain** | `String`, The base URL of your instance of the Qrvey platform. | Yes | 
| **user_id** | `String`, ID of the Qrvey Composer user account accessing this feature. Optional: You can alternately specify the user ID in a Qrvey session cookie. | Yes  |
| **clientId** | `String`, Unique identifier for the tenant end user. Required for using the End User Personalization feature. The clientId must be set to a unique value for each tenant end user. | No |
| **app_id** | `String`, ID of the Qrvey application containing the webform.| Yes |

#### Time Zone Configuration
The Qrvey platform enables end users to display dates and times in their local time zone. The Qrvey platform stores data in UTC/GMT+0 and adjusts the time displayed to the end user based on their preferred settings. You can specify the time zone offset in the configuration object properties. For more information, see [Time Zone Support](../../10-Timezone%20Settings/timezone-support.md).
