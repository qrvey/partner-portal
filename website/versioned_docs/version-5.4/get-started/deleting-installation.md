To delete an existing installation, follow these steps:
1. Delete the deployment by clicking on the **Delete** button in the installation app UI. You can get the URL in step 3 of <a href="/docs/get-started/deploying-aws/initial-installation/">Initial Installation</a>.

2. Once the deployment has been removed, you will see the initial form in the UI. At this point, you can delete the Cloudformation template created in Step 2 of Installation Steps.

If using the AWS Marketplace version, unsubscribe from the Marketplace in the AWS console.
