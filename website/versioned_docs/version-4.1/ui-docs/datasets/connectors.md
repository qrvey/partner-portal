When you enter the **Connectors** area you will see a list of existing data sources â€“ if you have any. These sources may have been created by you or a Qrvey administrator. The **Source** column will display where data sources originated from.  Use the search box to find a specific data source if you have many connections.

To add a new data connection click the **Add Connectors** button and select from the available choices.  You can then follow the instructions for adding your connection string and credentials to complete the connection.

To edit or delete an existing connection use the three-dot menu in the right-most column of the row, containing the data connector you want to edit or delete.
