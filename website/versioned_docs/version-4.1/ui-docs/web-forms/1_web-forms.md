Web Forms are the mechanism with which Qrvey apps collect new information from humans. They're also the primary way people update existing data within Qrvey apps. 

## Types of Web Forms
Qrvey currently has three different types of web forms: forms, surveys and quizzes. Each of these form types is similar but has slightly different features, depending on your data collection use case.  Web form types are discussed in the next section. 

## Use Cases
Web Forms can be used in a variety of ways:  they can be a vital part of your Qrvey applications, residing inside the pages and reports you create with Qrvey; they can also be embedded into other websites or applications; and they can be shared in a variety of ways, including via social media or email. 

## What Makes Up a Web Form
Web Forms primarily include data fields, which are called questions if you’re creating a survey. Surveys may also include branching, which allows you to ask different questions based on the answers to the previous question.  Quizzes include a scoring feature that enables you to rank the results in the order they’re received. 

Every time a user completes a web form, the data is saved into Qrvey either as a new or existing record for analysis. The results of this analysis can then be included in workflows, pages and reports throughout the rest of your application.
