**Custom View** allows you to build custom visualizations for your data, which can then be used as part of reports, pages and workflows. Custom View also serves as your own personal dashboard view of what’s the most important in your dataset. 

To access Custom View, select it from the **Analyze** tab inside your web form or dataset.

## Custom View Operations
In the upper right corner you’ll find icon buttons to add **Formulas**, define **Bucketing**, **Export** data, and **Filter** data. These features are described briefly below and are covered in more detail on separate pages.

### Formulas
Use the **Formulas** button to define new columns which are calculated from existing columns.

### Bucketing
Use the **Bucketing** button to define new columns that map individual values to named ranges, known as buckets. For example, you could map city population to buckets such as "0 - 1,000", "1,001 - 5,000", etc. Or you could map USA states to buckets such as "Northeast", "Midwest", etc.

### Export
Use the **Export** button to export the data in CSV format or to export the charts in JPG or PDF format.

### Filters

Use the **Filters** button to show or hide the **Filters** panel, where all of the defined filters are listed. Some or all of your filters can be quickly enabled, revised, or disabled. Use the **Reset All** link to remove all filters from custom view.
