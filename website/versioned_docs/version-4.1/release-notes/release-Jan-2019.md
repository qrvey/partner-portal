*   **Database Connection.** Datatypes couldn't be edited for MySQL connection. 

*   **Web Forms - Saving Answers.** Save answers option wasn't working properly for Image Upload, Signature, Address, Lookup and Name fields. 

*   **Quiz - Custom Score Options.** A Quiz could be activated even when there was a condition that was not completed.  

*   **Web Forms - Performance.** When opening  a web form it took 15 seconds to show the content. 

*   **Datasets - Database Connection - Overlapping when Scrolling.** There was some overlapping between the columns table and the name/description box once the load was finished. 

*   **Tabular View - Editing Lookup Field With Branching.** Questions in branches that are generated from a lookup field using a Dataset as a source were failing when a user tried to edit the branch questions from Tabular View.

*   **Datasets - Database Connection - Loading Unsaved Data.** When a connection was edited, and the changes were saved users could continue to upload data again. However if the changes were not saved they shouldn't have been able to upload data. The "Load" button was active, which allowed users to "Load" at any time with or without saved changes.


### **Known Issues**

*   **Lookup Field - SQL Connection.** When the SQL connection is deleted, and it's being used in a lookup, no error is shown but the lookup field stops working. 

*   **Datasets - Database Connection - Oracle Tables.** When setting up the connection for Oracle, the Tables/View is not showing in the connection modal. 

*   **Form - Summary View - CSV Filter Exports.** Exporting a CSV from a Summary View ignores the applied filters. All the records are exported.

*   **Web Forms - Deleting Answers.** When a user executes a query trying to delete all answers from a web form, the application takes some time to completely delete all of the answers. The response time depends on the size of the web form dataset and the amount of records. 

*   **Custom View - Pie Chart - Labels.** When the values of a wedge are very low the labels from different wedges may be too close together and might overlap.  

*   **Spreadsheet - Custom View In Firefox.** The â€œAdd Chart" button doesn't launch Chart Builder in Firefox. 

*   **Crosstab -Totals.** Columns are showing only 25 rows of "Grand Totals" and the rest do not show. 

*   **Custom View - Chart Editor - Numeric Settings.** When the user changes chart numeric setting, the labels overlap the axis. 

*   **Data Links - Filters Panel.** When setting a filter using linked columns, the Total Record count shows the overall total for the entire dataset and not the filtered total of records. 

*   **Metadata Creator - DataRouter URL.** The URL is hardcoded in the app whereas it should be dynamic based on the installation.
