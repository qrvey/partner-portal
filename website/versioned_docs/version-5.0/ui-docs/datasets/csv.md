You can create connections from file uploads by using comma-delimited, CSV files. In this article, we’ll walk you through the steps to do so.

## Preparing Your Data
For the best results, we recommend that you first take a moment to make sure your CSV file is formatted correctly. Data should be organized into columns, with the first row containing the column headers. Now is probably also a good time to peruse your data to fix any mistakes and missing items, as well as remove any duplicate entries if they’re not desired.

Once you are convinced that your data is clean and tidy, you can continue uploading it to Qrvey.

## Creating a File Upload Connection 
To begin, enter your application and select **Data** from the menu on the left.

Next, go to the **Connections** section and select **File Upload**.

You will then be brought to the data upload screen where you can select any CSV file from your desktop or simply drag it into the window. You can provide it with a name and a description in the top box, as seen below.

Once the connection is saved, you can click on the **View Data** option to get a partial view of the data.

## Using File Data
Next, you can create a dataset from your file upload to use your data. Go to the **Datasets** tab, click on **New Dataset**, and select your file upload connection.
