**Q**: I had previously created users. Will they be able to see the chart’s data if record level security is enabled?

**A**: No, visuals will not render correctly, and a **“No data found”** message will appear in all charts. You will have to assign a security token to all the users who want to access charts and datasets with security enabled to see the data. After adding the security token, the users need to log out and log in again to update their permissions.
