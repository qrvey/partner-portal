Report Builder is a quick and easy way to build and publish reports. To begin, enter an application and click the Report Builder icon in the left toolbar.

## Creating a Report
Once inside the Report Builder, you can begin by clicking **Create New Report**.

## Editing a Report
Once your report has been created, you’ll see the main Report Builder interface. In the center, you’ll see a blank canvas, on which you can drag components from the menu on the right. Your report can contain multiple tabs, which can be created, renamed and reordered using the toolbar on the top edge of the canvas.

## Toolbar

In the toolbar, you will find the options to configure your report tabs and options to add content.

From the toolbar, you will also be able to access the chart builder by clicking on the chart icon. Once you configure and save your chart, this will be added to your page right away. 

There you can find page objects options: image, text, and button. When selecting the icon, you can click and drag the size of the object on the canvas. 

Once there are multiple objects added to a page, you will find the option to arrange your objects by sending them to the front or back. 

You can configure grid options such as showing the gridlines or the snap to grid option. 


Towards the right side of the toolbar, you will see the download button - you can use this to download the report data in CSV format. If there are multiple datasets being used on the same pages, they will be exported as separate files.


## Data & Configuration
In order to begin creating charts and filters for your reports, you will need to have configured at least one dataset first. This can be done in the <a href="docs/ui-docs/datasets/data_overview/"> <strong>Data section </strong></a>. 

Once you have one or a group of datasets ready, they will be displayed in the Data panel on the right side of the canvas. Here, you can search for a particular dataset and expand each dataset to find the created charts or summary panels that can be added to a tab. To add a chart just click and hold the chart’s blue box to drag and drop onto the canvas. You can also opt for Shift + Click to add multiple charts at the same time.

If you have a long list of datasets, you can also select favorites by clicking on the blue star. It will turn orange to indicate the dataset has been marked as favorite, and by clicking the orange button beside **Data**, you will see only your favorite datasets.

## Object Configuration
As you are building reports, you will need to use the Data & Configuration panel where you can find the configuration settings for each object added to a tab. 

![8_reports](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.qrvey.com/documentation_assets/ui-docs/builders/3.4.4.1_reports/8_reports.png#thumbnail-40)


For Text, Images, and Buttons you will find options to style fonts, colors, text alignment, and image aspect. 

To access the configuration options, you must click on the object you would like to work with. To switch back and view your datasets, you can click anywhere on the canvas. 

To reposition each object, you can click anywhere on the object and drag it to the desired position. You can also click on any of the nodes around the object to resize, and the “X” in the right corner to remove it from the page.

## Filters

The Filters menu item lets you easily manage global filters defined in your report, as well as all the filters defined in your panels. When you select the Filters menu item, you will see the list of filters defined. The filters are grouped under the headings Global Filters, Tab Filters, and Panel Filters. Panel filters are grouped by panel name.

To enable or disable all filters for a group, click on the toggle button or check-box next to the group’s name. To enable or disable an individual filter value, use the check-box next to it.

To create a new global filter, click the **Add Filter** button and choose your data source. Next, select the column in the drop-down list and select the scope of the filter, i.e. All or Current Tab. See the <a href="docs/ui-docs/builders/dataviews/filters"> <strong>Filtering Data</strong></a> page for further details.
