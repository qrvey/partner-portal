<h2 style="color:#FF8143; margin-top: -10px;"> Qrvey Version 3.3 </h2>

We released Qrvey V3.3 this month. The new release has new features, enhancements, and bug fixes, as usual. <br>
Some of the highlights of this release are:

* Data Links are now part of the shared application

* We switched to AWS Comprehend for text analysis

* Admins can configure schedules "data syncs" through the Admin Center

<!--truncate-->

A complete list of these enhancements can be found on the Partner Portal site:

<h2 style="color:#FF8143"> New Names, Familiar Features </h2>

We now have better names for different parts of the platform:

* The main "Qrvey application" is now called "Qrvey Composer"

* "Admin Portal" is now called the "Admin Center"

You will see these names in all future communication.

<h2 style="color:#FF8143">  New In Documentation </h2>

* User guides for Qrvey Composer are now part of the Partner Portal and can be found here: [https://partners.qrvey.com/docs/docs/ui-docs/basics/logging-in/](https://partners.qrvey.com/docs/docs/ui-docs/basics/logging-in/)

* Now you can search for a feature or keyword in all of the documentation, using the new search capability.

We will have another release before the end of the year. Here are some enhancements to look forward to:

* The first round of our Machine Learning features
