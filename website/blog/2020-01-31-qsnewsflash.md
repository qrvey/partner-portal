<h2 style="color:#FF8143; margin-top: -10px;">New Year, New Website</h2>

Qrvey updated the website earlier this month. In addition to a whole new look, you’ll also find all-new messaging that better explains who we are, what we do and all of the many ways you can use the Qrvey platform for your analytics needs. We also have additional resources to help spread the word about everything Qrvey can do. 

Be sure to <a href="https://qrvey.com/"><strong>check it out</strong></a> and let us know what you think.

<h2 style="color:#FF8143">Your Feedback Matters</h2>

A new <a href="https://partners.qrvey.com/docs/faqs/ask-us/"><strong>link</strong></a> has been added to the Partner Portal to gather your feedback. Let us know what you would like to see on the Portal and we will make your suggestions our priority. 

<h2 style="color:#FF8143">Enhancement Of the Portal</h2>

We held an internal idea session and gathered ideas around making the Partner Portal more useful. The three ideas with most votes were:

* Redesign the homepage of the Portal

* Include a link to JSD in the Portal

* Get user feedback in articles by adding a “Was this helpful?” question to each of them

These improvements are in the works and will take effect in the near future.

<h2 style="color:#FF8143"> New In Documentation </h2>

We have more content in the <a href="https://partners.qrvey.com/docs/tutorials/first-analytic-app/"> <strong> Tutorials </strong> </a> and <a href="https://partners.qrvey.com/docs/faqs/faqs-intro/"> <strong> FAQs </strong></a> sections of the documentation site. Check those out and provide us with your feedback.
