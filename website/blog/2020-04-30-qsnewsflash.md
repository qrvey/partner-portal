<h2 style="color:#FF8143; margin-top: -10px;">Version 5.1 Now Available
</h2>

Qrvey V5.1 is released on April 30th. This is a major release with drastic changes which is why the version spent a month in beta and was tried by some of our customers. This helped us improve and eliminate minor glitches along with some usability issues â€” a big <span style="color:#F3841C"> **THANK YOU**</span> to our beta customers for such valuable feedback!   
The new features and enhancements include: 
* Data preparation model that has been overhauled to enable joins between datasets and much more.
* An all-new chart builder experience where chart types can be switched in an instant.
* Complex data types in the Chart Builder.

With the release of the drastically different V5, the need for versioning in documentation became more apparent than ever before. We took immediate action and added the ability to choose your version from the header to filter the documentation.

Check out the feature on the 
 <a href="https://partners.qrvey.com/"> <strong> Partner Portal </strong> </a>and provide us with your feedback.
