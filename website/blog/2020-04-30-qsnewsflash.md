<h2 style="color:#FF8143; margin-top: -10px;">Version 5.1 Now Available
</h2>


Qrvey V5.1 was released on April 30th. This is a major release with significant changes, which is why the version spent a full month in beta being tested by some of our customers. This period helped us eliminate a few minor glitches and improve some usability issues â€” a big <span style="color:#F3841C"> **THANK YOU**</span> to our beta customers for your valuable feedback!   
The new features and enhancements include: 
* Data preparation model that has been overhauled to enable joins between datasets and lots more.
* An all-new chart builder experience where chart types can be changed in an instant.
* The addition of complex data types in the Chart Builder.
