The Trend Chart section only appears for grouped tables and can be used to set up a column or bar chart for each aggregated value over the values of another “Trend By” column, usually a date that can be grouped into months, quarters, years, or other units. 
As implied by their name, trend charts are used to analyze trends and changes in a value over time and find peaks and valleys of the data.
