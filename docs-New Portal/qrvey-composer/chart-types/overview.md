Qrvey Composer offers a variety of charts to choose from in Chart Builder. An important thing to keep in mind before starting to build your visualizations is what you want your data to do: compare values, show composition, display distribution of values, or analyze trends.

To help you choose the correct chart type for your goal, we have categorized the available charts into six groups: 

* <a href="/docs/qrvey-composer/chart-types/kpi-charts" target="_blank">**KPI Charts**</a>: give you information about aggregate measures in a selected dataset. KPI Charts are a good choice if you need to visualize a single metric, such as total sales or customer NPS score.
  * Indicator, Dial, Bullet
<br><br>

* <a href="/docs/qrvey-composer/chart-types/table-charts" target="_blank">**Table Charts**</a>: show data structured in columns and rows, and enable users to see the raw data (not aggregated) from the dataset as well as aggregated data grouped by one or more categories.
  * Table, Expandable Table, Crosstab
<br><br>

* <a href="/docs/qrvey-composer/chart-types/map-charts" target="_blank">**Map Charts**</a>: show geolocation-based data where Values are displayed as bubbles, dots, or shaded regions with the option for tooltips to display data points.
  * Dot Map, Bubble Map, Choropleth Map
 <br><br>

* <a href="xy-charts" target="_blank">**X/Y Charts**</a>: are used to compare data between different groups or categories. They are also used to track changes over time.
   * Bar, Line, Symbol, Min/Max
<br><br>

* <a href="/docs/qrvey-composer/chart-types/percent-total-charts" target="_blank">**Percent Total Charts**</a>: these charts visualize the percentage of a total value in your data. Percent Total Charts are appropriate for showing the composition of your data.
  * Funnel, Pie
<br><br>

* <a href="/docs/qrvey-composer/chart-types/multi-series-charts" target="_blank">**Multi-Series Charts**</a>: allow you to visualize multiple value fields as a separate series. Various data points (Values) are connected using lines, bars, or symbols to show continuous data.
  * Combo, Bar, Line, and Symbol Multi-Series charts. 
<br><br>

* <a href="/docs/qrvey-composer/chart-types/special-charts" target="_blank">**Special Charts**</a>: here you can find the charts used for special purposes.
