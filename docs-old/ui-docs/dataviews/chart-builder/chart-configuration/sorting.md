Qrvey provides comprehensive sorting options for all types of charts. Depending on the chart type, data might be sortable from each column pill, from the **Sort by** option in the **General** section, from the chart itself, or from the **Sorting** section in the Configuration panel. A comprehensive guide of all of these options can be found in the <a href="" target="_blank">Sorting the data</a> article. 

The **Sorting** section of the Configuration panel is available for charts that support sorting of data on any column, even if the column is not included in the chart. When the section is available, it contains a dropdown list where the column that is selected for sorting can be picked and the sort direction can be determined by clicking on the appropriate icon under the dropdown. The icons change depending on the data type of the selected column.

If the chart data has already been sorted by any of its columns, that column will be selected by default and all other options will be listed in an organized manner.

All selected numeric data columns must be aggregated using the **Aggregation** dropdown list.
