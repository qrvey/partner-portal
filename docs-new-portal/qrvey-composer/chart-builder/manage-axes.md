In general, you can manage chart axes by adding a label to the axes, decide if you want to show labels or not, and if so, choose the orientation of the values you want to display (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) and the format of these values among others.

There are some charts that support multiple data (or Y) axes, like for example the Combo Chart in the image below.

Itâ€™s important to note that the way you can manage chart axes depends on the type of chart you have chosen. To read more about managing axes in a specific chart, head to the Chart Types article.
