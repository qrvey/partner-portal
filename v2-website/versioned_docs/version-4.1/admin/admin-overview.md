## Admin Center

Admin Center is an application for managing your Qrvey instance, Data Router settings, Elasticsearch infrastructure options, and application deployments. This document provides information on how to set up your users (creators) and configure their Qrvey Composer. It also explains how to set up Data Router preferences and do client deployments.

## Admin Users

Admin users manage the entire Qrvey deployment from the Admin Center. There they can define the access that creators have to the different sections and features of Qrvey Composer. They can also access all content from the creators in order to share applications containing all of the created components or only selected components.

Admins do not manage a creator's content, the way a creator shares content with their viewers or define who the viewers are. This is managed directly from the creator's application.
