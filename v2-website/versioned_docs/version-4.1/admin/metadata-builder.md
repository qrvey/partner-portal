This is the place where Admins can create and manage everything related to Metadata, all from data mapping to complex transformations. 

All created Metadata will be listed as in the following example: 

![metadata_builder](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.qrvey.com/documentation_assets/admin/MetadataBuilder/1metadata.png#thumbnail)

The Administrator can filter and sort Metadata by status _Date Modified_ and _Name_, both ascending and descending.

To create a new Metadata, Admins must click the '**Create Definition**' button. A form to create, define and configure the metadata will be loaded in the following way:

![metadata_builder](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.qrvey.com/documentation_assets/admin/MetadataBuilder/3metadata.png#thumbnail) 

When creating a Metadata, Admins need to define a name for the Metadata.

Admins can start defining the column mapping. First, they need to indicate the number of columns.

Next, they should indicate column names and column types as well as "identifier columns" from the data.

Alternatively, Admins can type a JSON example or profile (data sample) of the columns.

Then, they can use the ‘**Autogenerate**’ button for the system to add the identified column names and their data types.

After defining the columns, Admins can create simple and complex transformations, all from the UI. They can create new columns depending on the selected transformation, or simply modify the current ones.

Furthermore, Admins can view and edit the JSON for the Metadata they are building and even load a file with the JSON structure: 

![metadata_builder](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.qrvey.com/documentation_assets/admin/MetadataBuilder/9metadata.png#thumbnail)

To store the Metadata, Admins must click the '**Save**' button. The system will verify that the metadata name is unique and that the column structure is consistent.

Back in the Metadata list, Admins can search for previously created metadata using the search field. 

![metadata_builder](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.qrvey.com/documentation_assets/admin/MetadataBuilder/11metadata.png#thumbnail)

Admins can enter a specific Metadata in order to view its details or edit it. For example, they can add a new column to the structure: 

![metadata_builder](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.qrvey.com/documentation_assets/admin/MetadataBuilder/12metadata.png#thumbnail)  

Once they have finished editing, they must click the '**Update**' button. 
![metadata_builder](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.qrvey.com/documentation_assets/admin/MetadataBuilder/13metadata.png#thumbnail)

Back in the Metadata list, Admins can delete what is no longer needed.
