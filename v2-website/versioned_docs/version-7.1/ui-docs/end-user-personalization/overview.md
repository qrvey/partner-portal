Everything that is created in Qrvey Composer is ultimately for the benefit of an “end user”. In some cases, the Composer persona may be the same as the End User, and in other cases they may be different people. However, in all cases, the permissions and interactions with the content are different between the two personas: **Composers create content that End users interact with**.

At the same time, different users may have different needs: Some prefer one chart over another. Some may like their pages to be filtered a certain way. Still, others may like their panels to be a different size or charts use different colors for added clarity.

All of this, and more, is possible through the **End User Personalization** feature. If enabled and properly configured, end users will have control over the content that is shared with them. This includes changing the layout of the page, swapping in or out charts that they want to see on their dashboards, as well as changing the chart types and filters. They can also revert to the original content if they wish to do so.

Personalization does not affect the original content that might be shared among a larger group of users. As a result, the same dashboard that can be accessed by different users may look very different for each of them and have little resemblance to the original. 

End users have to be authenticated in order for the personalization feature to work. This ensures that their settings are stored and can be accessed across different devices.

Through User Management, Composers can decide which pieces of content to show or hide to which group of users and if you embed the Page View widget in your product, developers can enable or disable the options that are going to be available in the widget for the authenticated end users to enjoy. All available options and personalization features inside the Page View and the Page Builder widget can be turned on or off in any combination desired.

Developers can refer to the <a href="/docs/embedding/widgets/app-building/widget-page-view/" target="_blank">Page View Widget</a> documentation for a guide to enabling individual personalization features.
If you are a Composer, please refer to the <a href="/docs/ui-docs/builders/user-management/" target="_blank">User Management</a> article to learn how to create end End Users can refer to <a href="/docs/ui-docs/eup-dashboards">Personalizing Your Dashboards</a> article to learn about personalization features that are available to them.
