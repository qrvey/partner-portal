Download Manager provides a central location to access and manage exported files. Exported files are created using the Download option available in a variety of features in Qrvey Composer, including Analyze, Dashboards, Automation, Subscriptions, and Pixel-perfect Reports. Types of exported files include images (JPG, PDF), data (CSV, Excel, PDF), and reports (PDF). The exported files are stored in AWS. 

To open Download Manager, click the Download Manager icon at the top right of the Qrvey Composer interface (next to your user name):

Download Manager displays a list of all exported files available to the current user, along with information about each file including file type, file name, size, creation date, and expiration date. 

You can perform the following tasks in Download Manager: 
* To download a file, click its **Download** link. The file will download to your computer. 
* To delete a file, click its **X** icon. 
* To sort the list, click a column header, and then click its UP or DOWN arrow.
* To filter the list, click the **Filter by** box and select a filter option.  
* To search for a file, enter a search string in the **Search** box. 
* To refresh the list of files, click on the **Refresh** button.

Download Manager is an embeddable widget. Click the **Embedding Options** button to obtain the helper code. For more information on embedding widgets, see [Embedding Overview](../../software-developer/04-Embedding%20Qrvey%20Widgets/overview-of-embedding.md).

Download Manager is not enabled by default. It is enabled using the **Customization** feature in Qrvey Admin Center. For more information, see [Customizing Qrvey Composer](../../admin/customizing-qrvey-composer.md).
