The Datasets page lists the Datasets that have been created, including the dataset name, the date it was created, the date it was last successfully loaded, the Data Sources connected to the dataset, the **Scheduling** or **Data Sync** (turned on or off), **Status** (active, draft, failed), whether the dataset is currently in use or not, how many records and columns there are in the dataset, and the type of the dataset. In the upper-right corner, there is a star icon used to mark a dataset as a *favorite*, and a three-dot menu where you can share/unshare the dataset, or permanently delete it.

In order to create datasets, there need to be existing connections. These connections are created in the *Connections* tab. Datasets can also be created from already existing datasets. 

The different statuses will indicate if the data was loaded successfully to the dataset and is **Active** and therefore ready to be used for creating visualizations, or if the data is loading and the dataset is in **Draft** state. When the data fails to load, the dataset card will show a red indicator and the status will be shown as **Failed**.

The Datasets page consists of three tabs:
* **[Design](../02-Design/overview-of-design.md)**
* **[Analyze](../02-Design/overview-of-design.md)**
* **[Activity Log](../03-Analyze/activity-log.md)**
