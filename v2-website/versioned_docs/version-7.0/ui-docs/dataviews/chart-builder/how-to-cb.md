Chart Builder is a rich component of Qrvey, with a lot of functionality and nuances that may go unnoticed. Because of this reason this entire section of the documentation site is dedicated to this feature. 
In order for you to find the information you need, it’s helpful to know how this section and its content has been organized:

* Chart Builder UI has been introduced, and its terminology explained, in the <a href="/docs/ui-docs/chart-builder/chart-builder-overview" target="_blank">Chart Builder Overview</a> article.
* The basics of how to build any chart can be found in the <a href="/docs/ui-docs/dataviews/chart-builder/creating-a-chart" target="_blank">Creating a Chart</a> article.
* The configuration options are plentiful and differ from chart to chart. You can find a short description of every possible configuration option under the <a href="/docs/ui-docs/dataviews/chart-builder/chart-configuration-overview" target="_blank">Chart Configuration</a> folder. The folder has individual articles for each section of the Configuration panel, in the order that they may appear in the UI. If the option needs a more detailed description, it has been expanded elsewhere:

    * If the configuration option is common among many charts it has its separate heading and description in the same article. 
    * If the option is specific to one, or a few, chart types, it is described in detail in that chart’s article under the <a href="/docs/ui-docs/dataviews/chart-types/bar-charts" target="_blank">Chart Types</a> folder.
    
Proper links have been provided in each case.
* Other important, and common, subjects have been explained in individual articles:
  * <a href="/docs/ui-docs/chart-builder/sorting-data" target="_blank"> Sorting the Data</a>
  * <a href="/docs/ui-docs/chart-builder/setting-chart-styles" target="_blank">Setting Colors and Themes</a>
  * <a href="/docs/ui-docs/chart-builder/tooltips" target="_blank">Applying Tooltips to Charts</a>
