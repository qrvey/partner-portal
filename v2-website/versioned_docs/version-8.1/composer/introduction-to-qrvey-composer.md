Qrvey Composer is one of the major components of the [Qrvey platform](../getting-started/intro-to-qrvey.md). It is a web-based application used by Data Analysts to create and manage datasets, visualizations, web forms, automations, and dashboards to share with external users. Qrvey Composer is used to create Qrvey applications.
