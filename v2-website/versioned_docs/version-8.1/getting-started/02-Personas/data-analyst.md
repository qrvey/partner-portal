Data Analysts use Qrvey Composer to set up datasets and create visualizations and dashboards to help end users find trends in their data.

## Essential Links for the Data Analyst
The primary technical resource for the Data Analyst is the [Qrvey Composer User Guide](../../composer/introduction-to-qrvey-composer.md).
