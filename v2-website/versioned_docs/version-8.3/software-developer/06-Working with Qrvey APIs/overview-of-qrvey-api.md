Qrvey provides a comprehensive set of REST APIs that can be accessed via standard HTTP requests and responses (GET, POST, etc.). You may use the Qrvey API to work with any of the core Qrvey platform features for data collection, automation, and analytics, or when integrating Qrvey into your own applications. For best results programming with Qrvey APIs, you should be familiar with performing the same tasks in the Qrvey Admin Center and/or Qrvey Composer applications.

Before using the Qrvey API, gather the following:
- The base URL of your instance of the Qrvey platform. 
- Your unique API key. All Qrvey API requests require an API key. It was provided in the welcome email that your organization received when your Qrvey instance was created. To obtain a new API key, contact your Qrvey account representative.

> **Note**: Never expose your organizationâ€™s base URL or API Key to external users in Production environments. Instead, use secure tokens to encrypt the base URL and API Key. For more information, see [Generating Security Tokens](../06-Working%20with%20Qrvey%20APIs/generating-security-tokens.md).
