The Advanced Settings tab provides advanced configuration options for your dataset. 

To open the Advanced Settings tab, click **Data** in the left menu, open your dataset, click the **Design** tab, and then click **Advanced Settings**. 

Advanced Settings provides the following options:
* Share Data
* Label Internationalization
* Discovered Columns
* Estimated Dataset Size

## Share Data
Specifies whether to make the dataset available to the rest of the organization. If enabled, users can create new datasets from this dataset. 

## Label Internationalization
Specifies whether to enable internationalization in the dataset. If enabled, the dataset name and column names can be translated to multiple languages. For more information, see [Configuring Dynamic Labels for Datasets](../../../../../software-developer/09-Internationalization/configuring-dynamic-labels.md).

## Discovered Columns
When a new column is discovered during a Data Source query, specifies whether to automatically add it to the dataset. 

## Estimated Dataset Size
Specifies the estimated size of the dataset based on its number of records. This option determines the number of shards allocated to the datasetâ€™s ES index, which helps the system optimize the performance of loading and displaying data. The default setting is Small. 

| Dataset Size | Number of Records | Number of Shards |
| ---- | --------- | ------ |
| **Small** | Up to 10M records | 1 shard |
| **Medium** | Between 10M and 250M records | 3 shards |
| **Large** | Over 250M records | 5 or more shards. If the node count is higher than 5, the number of shards equals the number of nodes. |
