Tokens are parameters or variables that act as containers for data. There are three categories of Tokens available: _System_, _Data_, and _User Defined_. Tokens can be used across different contexts in the application. 

## Types of Tokens
**System Tokens:** Standard tokens provided by the system.

**Data Tokens:** Tokens automatically generated from the rows/columns within a dataset and used to reference values from the data.

**User Defined Tokens:** Tokens created by you in text, numeric, or date format.

## Tokens Suggestion Box
The suggestion box is a guide to show which tokens are available. It can be accessed by typing two curly brackets **{{** into the text field where you want to use a token. The tokens that are available for that specific context will be shown on the corresponding drop-down list.

From this box you can also access the Tokens Management Modal by clicking on **Add/Manage Tokens**

## Token Management
This view will show the available data and user defined tokens, grouped into two corresponding tabs. Each token can be given a name, a value, an alias for easy reference, and a description. The User Defined tab is where you can create and manage your own tokens.

In the Data tab, youâ€™ll find automatically generated tokens for each column in your connected datasets. You can add aliases to any or all of these columns as needed.
