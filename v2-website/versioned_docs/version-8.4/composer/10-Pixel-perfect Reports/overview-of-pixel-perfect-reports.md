The Pixel-perfect Reports Builder enables you to build customizable report templates with precise control over the positioning and style of every element on the layout, down to the individual pixel. Pixel-perfect formatting is important when the output must meet exact specifications, such as in audit reports, tax forms, regulatory documents, shipping labels, and more. This feature also provides rigorous controls for formatting PDF and print output.     

To open the Pixel-perfect Reports feature, click the **Pixel-perfect Reports** icon in the left-hand navigation panel.

In the report editor, when creating fixed templates, the templates do not contain live data. The Preview or Export feature resolves the values, and the output displays with the complete data using as many pages as needed. 

Pixel-perfect Reports shares may familiar features with dashboards, including:
- **Filters**. In the Pixel-perfect Reports tool, filters are configured in the Filters panel. For more information on using filters, see [Introduction to Filters](../08-Filtering%20Data/overview-of-filters.md). 
- **Workflows**. The Send Email action in Workflows/Automation supports Pixel-perfect Reports. For more information, see the "Send an Email" section of [Send Actions](../09-Automation/send-actions.md). 
- **Formulas**. You can apply formulas to columns in the dataset. For more information, see [Working with Formulas](formulas.md). 
- **Embedding**. The Pixel-perfect Reports widget can be embedded in an application, and it supports CLS and RLS security to ensure that end users only have access to specified data. For more information, see [Embedding Overview](../../software-developer/04-Embedding%20Qrvey%20Widgets/overview-of-embedding.md) and [Pixel-perfect Reports Widget](../../software-developer/04-Embedding%20Qrvey%20Widgets/05-Widgets/pixel-perfect-reports.md). 

## Overview of the Editor
The Pixel-perfect Reports editor provides a variety of tools for creating reports, including designing the layout, setting up datasets, and configuring settings.

The Toolbar at the top of the page provides a variety of components that you can add to the canvas. On the right side, there are several collapsable configuration panels that enable you to configure the report, including its components, datasets, and filters.  

The majority of the interface consists of the canvas, on which the report is designed. By default, reports have two headers, two footers, and a body. They are defined as follows:
- **Report Header**. The cover page or header that displays only on the first page of the report. 
- **Page Header**. The header that displays on all pages of the report. Note that the Page Header does not display on the cover or back cover, if applicable.  
- **Body**. The principal section of the report.
- **Page Footer**. The footer that displays on all pages of the report. Note that the Page Footer does not display on the cover or back cover, if applicable. 
- **Report Footer**. The back cover page or footer that displays only on the last page of the report.
