Comparison and Thresholds sections appear only in KPI Charts and are described in more detail in corresponding Chart Types (<a href="" target="_blank">Bullet</a>, <a href="" target="_blank">Dial</a> and <a href="" target="_blank">Indicator Gauge</a>). 

The Comparison feature allows the chosen value to be compared against its value at a different point in time. 

Thresholds are used to create defined bands in the range of values of the KPI in order to make the gauge meaningful. For example, the number of sales, YTD, may fall below a defined threshold and be considered low.
