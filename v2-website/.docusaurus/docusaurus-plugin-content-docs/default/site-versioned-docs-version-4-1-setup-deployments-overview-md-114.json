  "description": "Qrvey is a 100% Cloud native product built with dozens of AWS services like Elastic Container Service (ECS), DynamoDB, S3, Load Balancers, Auto scaling, SES, SQS, etc. We deploy directly into your own Amazon Web Services (AWS) account. This gives you full control over your installation and data. You can decide how big a deployment you need and have full control to scale up or down as needed to balance cost with performance.",
