  "description": "A Qrvey application, or a Qrvey app in short, is a self-contained analytics project that can be used  directly, shared, distributed or embedded into other software applications.  Qrvey apps begin with data but can grow to include any number of analytic components â€”   charts, reports, web pages, and workflows which work behind the scenes. As an application owner, you can assign users, roles and permissions to your application.",
