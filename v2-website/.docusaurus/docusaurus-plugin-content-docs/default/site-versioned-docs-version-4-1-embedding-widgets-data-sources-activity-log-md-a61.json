  "description": "The Activity Log widget is used to review what happened in different parts of the application. In the initial release this is limited to events related to platform releases and the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) events of the applications. This is a really simple component easy to embed, with just a couple of parameters and has a minimalistic and clear design.",
