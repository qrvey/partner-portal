  "description": "Qrvey provides a set of controls to create and interact with filters across the application to refine the data based on your needs. You can find more details about these controls in the portal section Working with Interactive Filters. When embedding Qrvey’s widgets into your system, you may run into situations where you need to combine Qrvey’s filters with your own set of filter controls. This article walks you through the steps that are needed for passing the values of your own filters to embedded Qrvey widgets.",
