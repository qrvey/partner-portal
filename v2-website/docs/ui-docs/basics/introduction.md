In this document we’ll show you the basic features of the Qrvey Composer interface and how to navigate your way through them.  When you first log into Qrvey, you’ll see the following layout:

Click on the Qrvey logo in the upper-left corner whenever you want to get back to this startup page. The menu in the upper-right corner, shown below, provides options to manage your profile, view help documentation, and log out. Your current version of Qrvey is also displayed.

## Applications
Your Qrvey projects are called _Applications_ and can be found organized on the startup page based on how recently you’ve accessed them. To create a new application, click **Create Application**.

If other Qrvey users have sent applications to you, you’ll find them under the **Received Apps** tab. To install an application, click **Install**.  Use the arrow menu to delete an application or to send one to another user within the same Qrvey installation.

The **Activity Log** tab is where you’ll find a history of activity surrounding your applications, such as installations and deletions. The Activity Log can be searched or filtered to quickly find specific events. It can also be downloaded using the **Download Log File** option.
