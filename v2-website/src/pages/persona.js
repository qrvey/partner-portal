Through that channel the partner has direct access to our technical team to ask their questions,  If needed you can do screen sharing so our people can help you faster. We take your data privacy very seriously so we never take a screen snapshot or record the session without your permission.  Finally we have a database for issue tracking.

                                        You can assign four levels of priority to any issue: (1) critical (2) high (3) medium (4) low.  Qrvey team will provide daily updates on critical items, weekly updates on high priority items, bi-weekly updates on medium level and monthly updates on low priority items - at minimum.
